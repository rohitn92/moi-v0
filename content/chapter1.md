### SANGEET OR MUSIC

'Sangeet' or Music is the art of combining sounds so as to please the ear. In other words, any melodic or harmonic combination of notes whether produced by voice or Instrument is known as Music or 'Sangeet'. Music is one of the fine arts which is concerned with the combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotions. Technically speaking the term 'Sangeet' is a collective term or name of the arts of Vocal music, Instrumental music and Dancing. In common parlance 'Sangeet' means vocal music; and Instrumental music and Dancing are supposed to be depending on Vocal music. In fact, Vocal Music, Instrumental Music and Dancing are so intimately connected with each other that the term 'Sangeet' connotes or includes within its fold Vocal music, Instrumental music and Dancing. But in its restricted conno-tation the term 'Sangeet' means Vocal music. In short, Music or 'Sangeet' may be defined as the art of singing, dancing and playing on Instrument.

Music is the finest of the fine arts. It is of universal appeal. It influences the old and the young, the rich and the poor all alike. Love of music is innate in man and pervades the animal kingdom as well. It is harmless among of all the pleasures of life. It is, indeed, a bliss to enjoy and cultivate music. It is international and knows no barriers of religion, race, caste and creed. It is one of the joys of humanity. In short, music refreshes the mind and elevates the soul. It gives perfect mental peace and is a panacea for many ills.

It is said that once George Meredith told a woman. "God's rarest blessing is after all a woman". The woman atonce replied, "Rarer than that is music." Even Shakespear has rightly described the art of music in the following manner :-

> The man that hath no music in himself,
> Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
> Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils,
> The notions of his spirits are dull as night,
> And his affections dark as Erebus,
> Let no such man be trusted.
>
> **Shakespear (Merchant of Venice)**

The famous philospoher and writer Plato has written in his book entitled 'Ideal State' that music is very useful for men and the youth can make his life happy by means of music and physical exercise.

Even Dr. Rajendra Prasad has said, "Music occupies an important place in our lives......... From times immemorial we have learnt to appreciate music and to count it among the foremost achievements of man. Once Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru had remarked while hoisting the flag on the Red-Fort of Delhi, "The ways of relexation might differ in different countries. But there could be no dispute over the fact that relaxation through music was common everywhere. Music was not only interesting but also creative...... Music and poetry were necessary for the life of human being."

In fact, music is a big and sublime art. Its field is immeasurable. Its profundity and sublimity is unfathomable. Its entertainment is unique. Its effect is pure and holy. In short, it is more or less nector to the dying and ambrosia to the lover of it.

Such is the sublime art of music.
