### The two Systems of Indian Music

There are at present two different systems of Indian music current in the country known as Hindustani or Northern system of music and Karnataki or Southern system of music. Originally there was only one system of music prevalent throughout the length and breadth of India known as "Gram-Moorchhana-Jati" system. But after 13th Century due to certain geographical conditions and political upheavels there came into being the above men-tioned two different system of music.

**INDIAN MUSIC**
* Hindustani system of music.
    or
    Northern system of music.
* Karnataki system of music.
    or
    Southern system of music.

**Hindustani system of music** - That system of music which is prevalent throughout India excepting Madras Province, Mysore State, Andhra Pradesh and South Kanara is called Hindustani system of music or Northern system of music.

**Karnataki system of music** - That system of music which is prevalent in Madras Province, Mysore State, Andhra Pradesh and South Kanara, is called Karnataki system of music or Southern system of music.

Although the nucleus of the above two systems of music is the same, but they are perfectly independent of each other. The chief difference between the two lies in their two perfectly independent primary or foundation scales. The primary scale or Shuddha Scale of Hindustani system is commonly called 'Bilawal Scale which "very nearly"* corresponds with the European Scale of 'C' major. While the primary scale or Shuddha scale of the Southern system is called 'Kanakangi Scale. All the same there does exist some similarity between the two systems.

\* "very nearly" because the sixth note of our Hindustani Shuddha scale is slightly higher than that of the European scale.
