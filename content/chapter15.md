### Some Classical Forms Of Musical Compositions

#### DHRUPAD
Dhrupad Is a blue-blooded and high browed classical song and the most chaste style of Hindustani music having strict rules to be observed. It is purely a legacy of the temple music and Sanskrit Prabandhas. It owes its origin to the temple music of the 'Keertans' and 'Bhajans' sung at the morning and evening services in the temple at the time of worship. Raja Man Singh of Gwalior (1486-1516) is supposed to have started the Dhrupad style of singing. He was the great representative of this style. He composed several songs in this style and is said to have brought the Dhrupad style of singing to its present state. "This sort of composition has its origin from the time of Raja Man Singh of Gwalior, who is considered as the father of Dhrupad Singers". - *'Music of India' by Captain N. Angustus Willard. Page 67.*

Dhrupad is said to be the heroic song of India. "The style is very masculine, and almost entirely devoid of studied ornamental flourishes". It has the solemnity, the serenity and the dignity of its own. It is said that the style of Dhrupad is too masculine to suit the tender delicacy of female expression. Mr. Strangways has even said that the man who has the strength of five buffaloes, let that man sing Dhrupad.

Dhrupad consists of four parts, viz., Sthai, Antara, Sanchari and Abhog. It is mostly sung in Choutal and Teora Tala. 'Tanas' are not permissible in Dhrupad singing. Instead, the song is sung in Dugun, Chougun and Athgun layas.

There were four different styles of Dhrupad singing recognised in the past known as Banis. They were called (1) Dagar-Bani, (2) Khandhar-Bani, (3) Nohar-Bani and (4) Gourhar-Bani. These Banis or styles of Dhrupad singing are no longer current and it is not possible to distinguish the styles of singing of the said Banis.

The songs of Dhrupad are mostly in Hindi, Urdu and Vrij (Vrijbhasha) language. The speciality of Dhrupad is that the purity of the Raga is strictly maintained in it. When singing a Dhrupad, rules of the Ragas are strictly observed. Mr. Strangways has rightly said in his book entitled the music of Hindustan that "When there is any doubt about the exact form of a particular Raga, appeal is made not to Sanskrit authorities but to the traditional form of Dhrupad, in that the Raga is to be found in its purity".

Dhrupad singing was very popular in the past. Ustad Allahbande Khan of Alwar, Zakiruddin Khan of Udaipur, Nasiruddin Khan of Indore, Ziauddin Khan of Udaipur, Dagar-brothers, Rahimuddin Khan 'Dagar' (all these belong to the family of Allahbande Khan), Wazir Khan of Rampur, Chandan Choubey of Mathura, Radhika Mohan Goswami of Bengal, Gopeshwar Banerjee - all these were most renowned Dhrupad singers of the past.

#### DHAMAR and HORI
Dhamar and Hori are almost one and the same thing. When the Hori variety of song is sung in Dhamar-Tal, it is called Dhamar. In Dhamar and Hori the subject matter is mostly the description of the colour festival and the colour-throwing between Radha and Krishna. Dhamar has four parts, viz., Sthai, Antara, Sanchari and Abhog. It is mostly sung in Dhamar-Tala. It is sung with rhythmic evolutions of the wordings of the song known as Dugun, Tigun, Chougun etc. Bol-Tanas and Gamaks are also employed in singing Dhamar.

Hori too is sung like Dhamar. It also employs Dugun, Tigun, Chougun, Bol-Tana etc. and is sung in Dhamar Tala. Dhamar and Hori are mostly sung by Dhrupad singers. Khyal singers also sing Dhamar and Hori. In Hori the song mostly refers to the colour sports indulged in during the colour-festival or 'Holi festival'. It is sung in rhythmic evolutions of the wordings of the song in Dugun and Chougun etc.

#### KHYAL
The term Khyal is an Arabic word which means imagination. Khyal is a kind of classical song in which extempore development of the Raga with Alaps and Tanas is admitted. According to Dr. S. N. Ratanjankar Khyal is a sweet combination between the pure classical music of the Dhrupad and the folk-music. In Khyal, the musician is perfectly at liberty to elaborate it extempore according to his ability and inspiration, but within the limits of the Raga concerned and the general outline of the composition. "The style is extremely graceful, and replete with studied elegance and embellishments. In Khyal the subject generally is a love tale, and the person supposed to utter it is a female. Sultan Hussain Shirqui of Jounpore is the inventor of this class of song." - *Music of India by N. Augustus Willard. Page 67-68.*

There are two styles of Khyals, viz., Kalawanti-Khyal and Qouwali-Khyal. Sultan Hussain Shirqui of Jounpur (1458-1480 A.D.) is said to be the inventor of Kalawanti-Khyal and Amir Khusro, the poet and musician at the court of Alauddin Khilji, is the inventor of Qouwali-Khyal.

Adarang and Sadarang, the two brothers at the court of Mohammad Shah Rangeele (1719-1740 A.D.), composed thousands of Khyals which are current even to this day. These two brothers are said to be the descendants of Tansen. They themselves sang Dhrupads but composed Khyals and taught them to their pupils. They did not teach Khyal to the members of their own family and even did not allow them to sing Khyals. Wazir Khan Saheb, the famous singer at the court of the Nawab of Rampur, who belonged to the family of Sada Rang, never sang Khyal and used to sing Dhrupad alone.

There are two parts in Khyal, i.e., Sthai and Antara. Khyal is sung in all the Ragas of Hindustani music. The Talas employed in Khyal singing are: Ektal, Ada-Choutal, Jhoomra, Tilwada, Trital and Jhaptal. The songs of Khyal are mostly in Hindi, Urdu and Vrijbhasha. Alap, Tana, Bol-Tana, Gamak-Tana etc. are used in Khyal singing.

There are two types of Khyal, viz., Slow-Khyal and Fast-Khyal. Slow-Khyal is mostly sung in Ektal, Ada-Choutal, Jhoomra and Tilwada. It is generally sung in slow tempo. At first extensive Alap of the Raga is done and then different kinds of Tanas are sung. Fast Khyal is sung in Trital and Jhaptal. Generally fast Tanas and Bol-Tanas are used in it.

The Khyal singers began to impart practical training of Khyal singing to their pupils and the members of their family according to their own method and style of Khyal singing. Thus, different Khyal singers, having their own style of singing Khyals, came into being. They differed in their method of rendering the Ragas, in their pronunciation of the notes, in their rendering of Sthai, Antara and the different kinds of Tanas and Layakaries that they adopted. In this way, different schools of Khyal singing sprang up better known as 'Gharanas'. These were called Gwalior Gharana, Jaipur Gharana, Delhi Gharana, Agra Gharana, Kirana Gharana and Patiala Gharana.

Haddu Khan, Hassu Khan, Bade Mohammad Khan, Rahmat Khan, Alla-Fattu brothers, Shankar Rao Pandit, Balkrishnabua, Allahdiya Khan, Abdul Karim Khan, Faiyaz Hussain Khan (Aftab-i-Moosiqi), Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan, Vilayat Hussain Khan, Krishna Rao Pandit, Vinayak Rao Patwardhan, Pt. Vishnudigambar ji, Pt. Onkar Nath Thakur were the most renowned Khyal singers of the past.

#### TAPPA
Tappa is a musical lyric composition invented by Ghulam Nabi Shori (Shori is the pen-name), son of the famous singer and Qouwal Ghulam Rasool of Lucknow, who flourished during the time of Asaf-ud-daulah (1776-1797 A.D.) the Nawab of Oudh. Tappa was formerly sung by the camel-drivers of the Punjab. These songs recited the loves of Hir and Ranjha, equally renowned for their deep attachment.

It is said that Ghulam Nabi Shori went to Punjab, lived there for some time, learnt the Punjabi dilect, heard the songs of the camel-drivers of the province of Punjab and Sindh and then composed several songs similar to the music of the camel-drivers and called them Tappa. He himself sang those compositions. Thus, Tappa is said to have been invented by the famous Shori Miyan. "It has been brought to its present degree of perfection by the famous Shori Mian who in some measure may be considered its founder. Tappa was formerly sung by the Camel-drivers of the Punjab, and it was he who modelled it into the elegance it is now sung". - *'Music of India' by N. Augustus Willard, Page 68.*

Tappa has two parts, viz., Sthai and Antara. It is sung in some specific Ragas. It employs almost the same Ragas and Talas as are used in Khyal singing. It has long and charming Tanas and revels in ornamental flourishes. The turns and trills in Tappa are known as Murki, Khatka, Gitkidi etc., which are a speciality of Tappa singing. The wordings of the song are in the language spoken in the Punjab or a mixture of the dilect of Hindi and Punjabi. A special type of voice-production and voice-culture is needed for singing Tappa. Formerly, there used to be separate Gharanas (family of musicians) of Tappa singers who used to specialise in Tappa singing alone. Shori Miyan, Miyan Hamdan, Alijan, Tasadduq Hussain have been the most renowned Tappa singers of the past.

#### THUMRI
Thumri is a sweet and amorous song refined in the classical style. Thumri style of singing is said to have been introduced by the members of the family of Ghulam Nabi Shori, the inventor of Tappa style of singing. In Thumri the word sense is quite important. The Thumri singer has got to sing Thumri in confirmity with the delicacy of the word sense. He is not expected to be violent or jerky in his vocal modulations when singing Thumri.

There are two types of Thumris, viz., Thumri of slow tempo and Thumri of Medium tempo. Slow tempo Thumri is sung in Theka-Thumri, i.e., Punjabi Tal (a form of Trital) and in Deepchandi; while Medium tempo Thumri is sung in Trital and Dadra. Thumri has two parts, i e., Sthai and Antara. The wordings of Thumri are in the dilect of 'Vrij bhasha'. It is sung in Ragas like Khamaj, Kaphi, Peelu, etc. It does not employ sober Ragas like Darbari, Todi, Marwa, Shri, etc. It has amorous theme and describes some love affair. "There is in it more of acting expression, voice modulation and feminine grace suitable to the word sense".

In Thumri short but beautiful Tanas are mostly used. Sometimes beautiful blending of different Ragas is also shown. For example, while singing a Thumri in Raga Peelu the tinge of Kaphi and Bhimpalasi is also shown very skilfully. The whole technique of Thumri singing lies in passing from one note to another in a very graceful manner. In short, Thumri style of singing in simply enchanting.

Lucknow and Varanasi are famous for Thumri singing and Thumri is mostly sung at these two places. Lalan Piya, Qadar Piya, Ishqa Rang and Bindadin have been the great Thumri composers and singers of the past.

#### GHAZAL
Ghazal is also a kind of song. Ghazals are mostly in Urdu and Persian language. A Ghazal must have atleast four couplets. Because, any composition of a poem having less than four couplets cannot be called a Ghazal. "The Ghazal has for its theme a description of the beauties of the beloved object, minutely enumerated, such as the green beard, moles, ringlets, size, shape, etc. etc., as well as his cruelties and indifference and the pain endured by the lover". - *'A Treatise on the music of Hindustan' by Captain N. Augustus Willard. Page 70-71.*

Ghazals catch the listener's imagination because of their sweet and convincing words. Like other folk-songs repetition of the same cadences of music is quite frequent in Ghazals also. Ghazal is mostly sung in those Ragas in which Thumri is sung. Those who have good knowledge of Urdu can sing Ghazals very well.

#### TARANA
Tarana is also a kind of classical song. Tarana is an interesting composition consisting of syllables like: 'Odani Deem Tadeem Tana Derena' etc. Besides, it consists of some syllables of Pakhawaj or Tabla and also one or two couplets of Urdu language. Tarana has two parts, viz., Sthai and Antara. Fast Tanas are sung in Tarana both in Barabar-ki-laya and in Dugun-Laya. Taranas are sung in fast tempo and the skill lies in correct and clear pronunciation of the syllables and ocassional rhythmic evolutions. In Tarana we enjoy both the Raga and Laya.

Bahadur Hussain Khan, Tanras Khan and Natthu Khan were the most renowned Tarana singers of the past and their Taranas are still current and sung even to this day.

#### CHATURANG
Chaturang is a composition having four parts, viz., a combination of Khyal, Tarana, Sargam and Trivat. The first part has the words of the song of a Khyal, the second part has the syllables of a Tarana, the third part has the notes of the Raga in which it is set and the fourth part has the syllables or a 'Paran' of the Pakhawaj. In other words, a chaturang has the Boles of a song, syllables of Tarana, notes of the Raga that is being sung and the syllables of the Pakhawaj, one after the other, respectively.
