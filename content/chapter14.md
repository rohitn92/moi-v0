## CHAPTER XIV
### The Notation Systems of Pt. Bhatkhande and Pt. Vishnudigamber

There are, at present, two different Notation Systems prevalent in Hindustani System of Music popularly known as Bhatkhande-Notation-System and Vishnudigamber-Notation-System.

#### Bhatkhande-Notation-System
In Hindustani System of Music there are seven principal notes known as Shadja, Rishabha Gandhara, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivata and Nishada. These are designated by their initial syllables as 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni' and are called 'Shuddha-Swaras'. The two notes 'Sa' and 'Pa' are supposed to be constant. They do not change their fixed places. The remaining five notes, viz., 'Re Ga Ma Dha Ni' are subject to change. Four of these, viz., 'Re Ga Dha Ni' become flat or Komal and the remaining one note, i.e., 'Ma', which is already flat or Komal, becomes sharp or Teevra. Thus, including the Vikrits of the five notes 'Re Ga Ma Dha Ni', there are in all twelve notes known as `Sa Re_ Re Ga_ Ga Ma Ma' Pa Dha_ Dha Ni_ Ni`.

(1) **Sharp-notes** or Shuddha-Swaras, excluding sharp or Teevra 'Ma', do not require any symbol to indicate them as sharp or Shuddha notes.

(2) **Flat notes** or Komal-Swaras, excluding flat (Komal) 'Ma', are identified by putting a small horizontal line or a dash below the notes, e.g., `Ga_ Dha_ Ni_`. These are flat or Komal notes. Flat (Komal) 'Ma' does not have any such sign.

(3) **Sharp or Teevra 'Ma'** is identified by a short perpendicular line over it, e.g., `Ma'`.

(4) The notes of '**Mandra-Saptak**' or the Lower-Octave are symbolised by putting a dot below those notes, e.g., `Pa. Dha. Ni.`.

(5) The notes of **Madhya-Saptak** or the Middle-Octave have no such signs, e.g., 'Ga Ma Pa Dha'.

(6) The notes of **Tar-Saptak** or Higher Octave are symbolised by putting a dot over those notes, e.g., `'Sa 'Re 'Ga`.

(7) The notes which have the **sign of a Tie** `___` below them indicates that the notes are to be pronounced in one Matra or one unit of time. For example, `GaMa`, `MaPaDha`, `PaDhaNiSa` these indicate that 'Ga Ma' the two notes are to be pronounced in one unit of time, 'Ma Pa Dha' these three notes in one unit of time and 'Pa Dha Ni Sa' these four notes in one Unit of time. In other words, to pronounce the notes `GaMa`, given in a 'Tie', 'Ga' will be pronounced in ½ unit of time and 'Ma' in another ½ unit of time. Similarly, in case of `MaPaDha` given in a 'Tie', 'Ma' will be pronounced in ⅓ unit of time, 'Pa' in ⅓ unit of time and then 'Dha' in ⅓ unit of time.

(8) The sign `︵` indicates '**Meend**'. When this sign is put over the notes `Ga Ma Pa` in this way, then the notes are pronounced gracefully through 'Meend' or glide without silencing the voice.

(9) The sign **-** indicates **pause**. When this sign is put after a note like this 'Ma-', then after pronouncing 'Ma' pause will be made, i.e., 'Ma' will be pronounced in one unit of time and then a pause will be made for another one unit of time.

(10) When this sign **S** is put after the 'Bole' of a song, then that 'Bole' is prolonged for as many units of time as there are such signs, For example, 'MO S'. Here, the Bole 'MO' will be pronounced in one unit of time and then it will be prolonged for another one unit of time.

(11) `<sup>Ma</sup>Pa`-When a neighbouring note, higher or lower, is attached to the main note, it is called **grace-note or 'Kan'**. For example, `<sup>Ma</sup>Pa`. Here, 'Ma' is the grace-note or 'Kan' on 'Pa'. Therefore, before pronouncing 'Pa' a slight touch of 'Ma' the grace-note will have to be made.

(12) **(Pa)** - When a note is put within two brackets as '(Pa)' it means that 'Pa' will be pronounced twice quickly touching its higher and lower neighbouring notes. In other words, at first the higher neighbouring note 'Dha' will be pronounced, then 'Pa' will be pronounced, then 'Ma' the lower neighbouring note will be pronounced and then again 'Pa' will be pronounced. For example, '`Dha Pa Ma Pa`' or `<sup>Dha Ma</sup>Pa Pa` these notes will be pronounced in quick tempo.

(13) The **sign of 'Comma'** indicates very slight stoppage. For example `Dha Ni Sa, Dha Ni`. Here, there are five notes in one unit of time. Therefore, 'Dha Ni Sa' these three notes will be pronounced in ½ unit of time and 'Dha Ni' the remaining two notes in another ½ unit of time.

(14) **'^'** - This is a sign of '**Gamaka**'. For example, `^Ga ^Ga`. Here, 'Ga Ga' these two notes will be pronounced through 'Gamak'.

(15) '**X**'-This sign indicates the '**Sam**' of a Tala or 'Gat'. In other words, the starting point of a Tala or Song. The 'Sam' is shown with some force or emphasis, over and over again, after every Alap or 'Tan'. 'Sam' is also the concluding place of a song or Gat.

(16) '**O**' - The sign of Zero indicates the **no-beat or 'Khali'** of a Tala, i.e., the place of a Tala where there is no beat.

(17) **Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4** in a Tala indicate the first, second, third and fourth beat of a Tala.

#### Vishnudigamber Notation System
(1) **Sharp notes** or Shuddha-Swaras, excluding Teevra 'Ma', do not require any sign to indicate them as sharp or Shuddha notes, e.g., 'Ga, Dha, Ni'.

(2) **Flat notes** or Komal-Swaras, excluding Komal 'Ma', are identified by putting a sign or attaching a sort of symbol under the notes, e.g., `Dha_ Ni_ Dha_` or `Ga_ Re_ Ga_`.

(3) The notes of the **lower Octave** or Mandra Saptak are indicated by putting a dot over them, e.g., `'Pa 'Dha 'Ni 'Dha 'Pa`.

(4) No symbol is required for indicating the notes of the **Middle Octave** or Madhya-Saptak, e.g., 'Ma Pa Dha Ni Dha Pa'.

(5) The notes of the **higher Octave** or Tara-Saptak are indicated by putting a short perpendicular line over the notes, e.g., `Ma| Pa| Dha|`.

(6) To indicate the notes to be pronounced in **one unit of time** a 'Dash' is put under the notes, e.g., `Ga- Ma- Pa- Dha-`.

(7) To indicate the notes to be pronounced in **two units of time** a kind of symbol such as this `~` is put under the notes, e.g., `Ga~ Ma~ Pa~ Dha~`.

(8) For indicating the notes of **½ unit time** a Zero-like sign is put under the notes, e.g., `GaO MaO PaO`.

(9) For indicating the notes of **¾ unit of time** a sort of Tie is put under the notes, e.g., `(Dha Pa Ma)`. (Symbol is a single tie `︶`).

(10) For indicating the notes of **⅛ unit of time** two Ties are put under the notes, e.g., `(Ga Ma Pa)`. (Symbol is two ties `︶︶`).

(11) For indicating the notes of **⅓ unit of time** a symbol like this ` V ` is put under the notes, e.g., `GaV ReV SaV`.

(12) To indicate the notes of **⅙ unit of time** two signs of this kind `VV` are put under the notes, e.g., `GaVV ReVV SaVV`.

(13) To prolong the notes or to make a pause on the notes a kind of symbol like this **S** is put after the notes, e.g., '`Ga S Ma S`'.

(14) To prolong the Boles or the words of a song some dots are put after the notes, e.g., '`Ja... Ja....`'.

(15) The sign of **Comma** indicates pause after pronouncing the notes, e.g., "`Sa, Re, Ga`".

(16) '**।**' This kind of sign indicates the end of one round of a song.

(17) '**।।**' This kind of sign indicates the end of the 'Sthai' or the first part of a song.

(18) '**।।।**' This kind of symbol indicates the end of the entire song.

(19) `<sup>Ma</sup>Pa` This indicates that there is the '**Kan**' or grace note of 'Ma' over 'Pa'.

(20) `︵` This is the sign of '**Meend**', e.g., over `Dha Ni Sa`. This indicates that 'Dha Ni Sa' these three notes are to be pronounced through 'Meend'.

(21) '**१**' The sign of the '**Sam**' or the principal beat of a Tal or a song.

(22) '**+**' The sign of '**no-beat**' of a Tal, i.e., there is no beat of the Tal on that place.

**Note** :-It may be said here that the notation system of Pt. Bhatkhande is easy and simple and can be easily understood by one and all. Not only this, but it is also followed by most of the musicians as well as the students of music.
