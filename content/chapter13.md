### A Short History of the Notation System of Indian Music

The art of describing musical ideas in written characters is called Notation. It is a system of writing a song or Gat in Swara and Tala. If the words of a song or the Boles of a Gat are written in Swara and Tala, it will be called the notation of that song or Gat. If the Alap of a Raga is written in musical characters, it will be called the notation of that Alap. Similarly, if a Tala is written with its Boles, Matras Tala-marks etc., it will be called the notation of that Tala.

The notation system had been in existence in our country ever since the time of Panini, about 500 B. C., the famous Grammarian. According to Sir William Wilson Hunter, "A regular system of notation had been worked out before the age of Panini...............and the seven notes were designated by their initial letters. This notation passed from the Brahmins through the Persians to Arabia, and was thence introduced into European music by Guido d' Arezzo at the beginning of the 11th century". - 'Imperial Gazetteer of India' by W.W. Hunter.

It is well known that our music has recourse to the three Octaves known as Mandra (Lower), Madhya (Middle) and Tara (Higher). Our ancient writers used certain symbols to represent the notes of the said three Octaves. Pandit Sharangdeva, the author of the famous treatise entitled 'Sangeeta Ratnakara', has indicated the notes of the lower Octave (Mandra Saptak) and the higher Octave (Tara Saptak) by putting a dot and a short perpendicular line respectively at the top of the initial letters of the notes. For example, "`'Ma 'Pa 'Dha 'Ni`" indicate the notes of the lower Octave and "`'Sa 'Re 'Ga`" indicate the notes of the higher Octave. The Boles or the words of a song which had to be prolonged were indicated by putting the sign of a Zero "O" after the words to indicate stoppage on them. For example, "**हर O मु O**" which indicated stoppage after 'Har' and 'Mu'. And when a note had to be pronounced in one Matra, one unit of time, it was written thus: '**गा पा धा**'. This indicated one note in one Matra time-duration or in one unit of time. And when two or three notes were pronounced in one Matra, they were written thus: `प ध`, `प ध नि` respectively. In other words, `गा पा धा` each of these notes indicated one note in one Matra, `प ध` indicated two notes in one Matra and `प ध नि` indicated three notes in one Matra.

The ancient writers did not have any separate symbols to denote sharp and flat (Teevra and Komal) notes of the Octave. Because, they held that when the notes of a Thata were laid down and the Ragas coming under them were enumerated, there was no need to symbolise again the sharp and flat notes of the Raga. For example, if a Raga belonged to a particular Thata having 'Ga' and 'Ni' Komal (flat), it was presumed that the notes coming into the Raga would be Komal (flat) and there was no need to further symbolise the said two Komal (flat) notes.

Later on, in the seventeenth century when Pt. Vyankatamakhi expounded the 72 Thatas (Melakartas), he Introduced certain new signs and conventional letters to denote his Shuddha and Vikrit Swaras (sharp and flat notes). He used the symbols 'अ', 'इ' and 'उ' to indicate them. He wrote his Komal (flat) 'रे' as 'र', Teevra (sharp) 'रे' as 'रि', Komal (flat) 'ग' as 'ग' and Teevra (sharp) 'ग' as 'गि'. He wrote his three 'Rishabhas', viz., Shuddha 'रे' (our Komal (flat) 'रे') as 'र', Panch-Shruti 'रे' (our Komal (flat) 'ग') as 'रि' and Shat-Shruti 'रे' (our Komal (flat) 'ग') as 'रु'. Similarly, he wrote his three Gandharas as 'ग', 'गि' and 'गु', his three Dhaivatas as 'ध', 'धि' and 'धु' and his three Nishadas as 'न', 'नि' and 'नु'. Thus, we find that in the 17th century there was some improvement in this direction.

Our ancient writers were also aware of the importance of Tala and had certain symbols to write the Talas in Tala-notation. They used the following six symbols for the purpose:-

| No. | Symbol | Name | Matra-Duration |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | ऽ | Anudrut | One Matra |
| 2. | 0 | Drut | Two Matras |
| 3. | । | Laghu | Four Matras |
| 4. | S | Guru | Eight Matras |
| 5. | 3 | Plut | Twelve Matras |
| 6. | + | Kakpad | Sixteen Matras |

Today we have a fully developed form of notation system. There are, at present, two different notation systems prevalent in 'Hindustani system of music' known as 'Bhatkhande notation system' and 'Vishnudigambar notation system'.
