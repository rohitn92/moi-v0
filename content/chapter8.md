## CHAPTER VIII
### ASHRAYA RAGA

It has already been described in the Chapter having the description of 'THATA' that in order to recognise a 'THATA' it is named after a big and famous Raga produced therefrom. This rule of assigning names to the 'THATAS' has been recognised by all the writers on music, both ancient and modern, and it is an accepted principle of Hindustani System of music even to this day.

'Ashraya Raga' is that big and famous Raga after whose name the name of its 'Thata' is assigned. As for instance "Sa Re Ga_ Ma Pa Dha Ni_ 'Sa" this collection of notes, which has Ga and Ni flat (Komal), indicates that it is "Kaphi Thata". Now this Swara-Saptak or the gamut of seven notes has been named as 'Kaphi Thata' because a big and famous Raga known as 'Kaphi' is derived from this 'Thata'. And since a 'Thata' is named after a big and famous Raga produced therefrom, therefore "Sa Re Ga_ Ma Pa Dha Ni_ 'Sa" this collection of seven notes has been named as "Kaphi Thata". Hence that big and famous Raga after whose name the name of its 'Thata' is assigned is called "Ashraya Raga".

It may be remembered here that Ragas which are produced from the same 'Thata' have some tinge of the Ashraya Raga of that 'Thata'. In other words, Ragas that are produced from Kaphi Thata have some tinge of Kaphi Raga in them which is the Ashraya Raga of Kaphi Thata. As for example, while singing a Raga derived from Kaphi Thata if a musician just goes astray from the independent rules of that particular Raga, it is quite likely that some tinge of Kaphi Raga may become visible in that particular Raga.

Ashraya Raga is also known as Thata-Vachak-Raga or the Raga which suggests the name of the Thata of a Raga. In Hindustani system of music there are in all ten Ashraya Ragas known as Yaman, Bilawal, Khamaj, Bhairava, Poorvi, Marwa, Kaphi, Asawari, Bhairavi and Todi. All these ten Ragas are big and famous Ragas having wide scope.
