### THATA

That collection of notes which is capable of producing Ragas is known as 'Thata'. In other words, the 'Swara-Saptak' or the gamut of seven notes which has 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni' in this serial order and which is capable of producing Ragas is called 'Thata'.

**Explanation:**- A Thata is a collection of notes capable of producing Ragas.

The Hindustani system of music admits of twelve notes in an Octave known as 'Sa Re Re_ Ga Ga_ Ma Ma' Pa Dha Dha_ Ni Ni_'. Out of these twelve notes 'Thatas' or 'Parent modes' have been obtained by the mathematical process of permutation and combination or variations of the said twelve notes in a serial order. Pandit Vyankatamakhi a great musician and writer of the South, who flourished in the 17th Century, has in his book entitled 'Chaturdandi Prakashika' gone through all these mathematical calculations and has laid down clearly the precise number of 'Thatas' so produced. According to him seventy-two 'Thatas' in all can be produced mathematically from the above mentioned twelve Shuddha and Vikrit Swaras or sharp and flat notes. It was Pandit Vyankatamakhi who for the first time expounded the theory of 72 'Thatas'. Out of these 72 'Thatas' only 10 of them, which have been considered suitable for the purposes of Hindustani Music, have been selected for the classification of our Ragas thereunder. These ten 'Thatas' are known as Bilawal, Yaman or Kalyan, Khamaj, Bhairava, Poorvi, Marwa, Kaphi, Asawari, Bhairavi and Todi under which all the Ragas of Hindustani system of music have been conveniently classified. Even Pandit Vyankatamakhi himself selected only 19 of these 72 'Thatas' (Melakartas) and classified all the Ragas of the South current in his time under the said 19 'Thatas'.

#### Essentials of a Thata

(1) A 'Thata' must always have all the seven notes of the scale. Seven notes are necessary for a 'Thata'. A Raga may have less than seven notes but not a 'Thata'. Besides, since Ragas are derived from Thatas and certain Ragas have seven notes also, therefore if we accept less than seven notes in a 'Thata', Ragas having seven notes cannot be produced from such 'Thatas'. Hence seven notes are indispensable for a 'Thata'.

(2) The notes of a 'Thata' must always come in a serial order. The seven notes of a 'Thata' must be 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni' with these nomenclatures and in this order. A Raga may or may not have these notes in this order but it is necessary for a 'Thata' to have these notes in a serial order.

(3) Two notes of the same denomination may occur one after the other in a 'Thata'. Since a 'Thata' takes the notes in a serial order, therefore both sharps and flats of the same note may come one after the other in a 'Thata'.

(4) A 'Thata' has only the Ascent or 'Aroha'. It must not have both the Ascent and the Descent. Because a 'Thata' is recognised by the Ascent alone. As for instance, 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni_ Sa' this collection of notes atonce indicates that it is Raga 'Kaphi'. Therefore a 'Thata' has only the Ascent.

(5) A 'Thata' need not necessarily please the listeners. In other words, 'Ranjakta' or musical value is not necessary for a 'Thata'. Since two notes of the same denomination may come one after other in a 'Thata', therefore in such a case it is not possible to have musical value in it. Hence it is not necessary for a 'Thata' to have 'Ranjakta' or musical value.

(6) A 'Thata' is named after a big and famous Raga produced therefrom. As for instance, Kaphi-Thata' has been named after the big and famous Raga known as 'Kaphi'. Now Raga 'Kaphi' is derived from 'Kaphi-Thata'. And it is also a big and famous Raga. Therefore the name of 'Kaphi-Thata' has been named after Raga Kaphi.

Now the question arises as to how did Pandit Vyankatamakhi construct the 72 'Thatas' out of the recognised twelve notes mathematically. The process for obtaining the 72 Thatas of Pandit Vyankatamakhi is as follows:-

First write down the twelve notes of the scale in their serial order thus: "Sa Re_ Re Ga_ Ga Ma Ma' Pa Dha_ Dha Ni_ Ni". Now omit sharp (Teevra) 'Ma' for a moment and instead add 'Sa' of the higher Octave at the end in order to complete the series or string of the 12 notes. Thus we have before us a series or string of 12 notes thus: "Sa Re_ Re Ga_ Ga Ma Pa Dha_ Dha Ni_ Ni 'Sa". Now divide these 12 notes into two equal parts thus; 'Sa Re_ Re Ga_ Ga Ma' and 'Pa Dha_ Dha Ni_ Ni 'Sa'. Now we have got to find out as to how many 'Thatas' or 'Melakartas' can possibly be had from the said 12 notes. A complete 'Thata' or 'Melakarta' must have all the seven notes in their serial order. And since we have divided the string of the 12 notes into two parts, therefore' each of the two parts will produce only a certain number of half scales or half Melakartas having the names 'Sa Re Ga Ma' and 'Pa Dha Ni Sa' respectively. While constructing the half-scales from the six notes of each part we must follow the rule laid down by Pandit Vyankatamakhi, namely, that the first and the last note must represent the extremities in every one of the half-scales, i.e. 'Sa' and 'Ma' in the first half-scale and 'Pa' and 'Sa' in the second half-scale. Now by the simple method of permutation and combination six half-scales of four notes from the first part of the series can be constructed as under :-

1. Sa Re_ Ga_ Ma
2. Sa Re_ Ga Ma
3. Sa Re_ Ga Ga Ma
4. Sa Re Ga Ma
5. Sa Re Re Ma
6. Sa Ga Ga Ma

A similar procedure will enable us to construct six half scales of four notes from the second part of the series as under :-

1. Pa Dha_ Ni_ 'Sa
2. Pa Dha_ Ni 'Sa
3. Pa Dha_ Ni Ni 'Sa
4. Pa Dha Ni 'Sa
5. Pa Dha Dha 'Sa
6. Pa Ni Ni 'Sa

Now to obtain a full or complete 'Seven-notes-scale', i.e. a 'Thata' or 'Melakarta', we shall have to tack on the half-scales of the second part to the half-scales of the first part. Thus we tack on all the six half-scales of the second part to each of the six half-scales of the first part and thereby obtain 36 full-scales having flat (Komal) 'Ma'. Now if we replace this flat 'Ma' by sharp (Teevra) 'Ma', which had been purposely left out, we shall atonce obtain another set of 36 full scales having sharp (Teevra) 'Ma'. Thus we obtain 36 'Thatas' having flat 'Ma' and 36 'Thatas' having sharp 'Ma', i.e. 36+36=72 'Thatas' in all. And this is how Pandit Vyankatamakhi constructed the 72 'Thatas' mathematically from the recognised 12 notes of the scale.

It may be noted here that 'Thatas' are not meant for singing. A 'Thata' is only a 'Swara-Saptak' or the gamut of seven notes, neither more nor less, out of which Ragas having five, six or seven notes have been derived. It is the 'Thata' which indicates the sharp and flat notes of a Raga. In place of the ancient 'Murchhanas today we have 'Thatas' in our modern Hindustani system of music.
