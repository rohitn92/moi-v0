## CHAPTER XII
### The four groups of Musical Instruments

The Musical Instruments of India have been broadly classified under four groups, namely, (1) Tata Vadya, (Chordophones), (2) Avanaddha Vadya (Membrophones) (3) Sushir Vadya (Aerophones) and (4) Ghana Vadya (Autophones).

**Tata Vadya or Chordophones** - Those string Instruments which are played with the bow, plectrum and fingers are called 'Tata Vadya' or 'Tantu Vadya', e.g., Veena, Sitar, Sarod, Violin, Israj, Sarangi, Tambura etc. These are called string Instruments and are also known as Instruments of 'Swara'.

**Avanaddha Vadya or Membrophones** - Those Instruments which are made of hollow cylinder or hemisphere with parchment stretched over the openings and which are played with the fingers of both the hands are called Avanaddha Vadya, e.g., Tabla, Mridang, Dhol or Dholak etc. These are called percussion Instruments and are also known as Instruments of 'Tala'.

**Sushir Vadya or Aerophones** - Those Instruments which are played with the blow of the mouth or by holes and Keyes are called Sushir Vadya, e g, Flute, Shehnai, Algoza, Clarionet etc. These are called wind Instruments and are also known as Instruments of 'Swara'.

**Ghana Vadya or Autophones** - Those Instruments which are played with small sticks or by percussion forcibly striking one solid body against another are called Ghana Vadya, e.g., Jhanj, Kartal, Manjeera, Jal-Tarang etc. These are called Pulsatile Instruments and are also known as Instruments of percussion or 'Tala'.

#### VIOLIN
Violin is a foreign Instrument. It cannot be said with certainty as to who invented the Instrument, but it can be definitely said that Violin was invented in Europe in the middle of the 16th century and is current even to this day.

There are three views current about the invention of Violin. One view is that about 5000 B. C. Ravan, the king of Lanka, had invented an Instrument having one wire and he used to play on it with a bow. That very one-wire Instrument passed from India through Persia, Arabia and Spain and was thence introduced into European music at the end of the 11th century. And on the very model of the one-wire Instrument Violin was invented.

Another view is that a three-wire Instrument, known as Rebeck, was current in Europe before 16th century. On the model of Rebeck a six-wire Instrument, known as viol, was introduced. Then in the middle of the 16th century Violin was introduced as a modified form of viol.

Still another view is that a German family known as Triffenbruckers used to manufacture a six-wire Instrument known as Lute. From this very German family one Mr. Gasparo-di-Solo, resident of Lombordy, invented Violin for the first time in 16th century.

Thus, from the above description it is clear that although it cannot be said with certainty as to which particular individual invented Violin but it can be definitely said, without doubt, that Violin was first invented in Europe as a modified form of Voil in the middle of the 16th century and was then current in Italy.

#### DIFFERENT PARTS OF VIOLIN
The different parts of Violin are known as Belly, Ribs, Neck, Head or Scroll, Pegs, Nut, Finger-Board, Bridge, Tail-Piece, Sound-Holes, Button, Sound-Post, Bass-Bar, Adjusters and Chin-Rest.

**Belly** - That part of the body of Violin which is made of wood and on which rests the Bridge, is called Belly.

**Ribs** - The sides all around the Belly are called Ribs.

**Neck** - The hind part of the Finger-Board which is joined with the Belly and which rests on the palm of the hand, is called Neck.

**Head or Scroll** - The curved portion towards the Pegs is called Head or Scroll.

**Pegs** - The keys of Violin which help in tightening or loosening the wires are called Pegs.

**Nut** - That small and thin piece of wood fixed just below the Pegs and at the end of the Finger-Board, is called Nut.

**Finger - Board** -- That black piece of wood fixed below the wires of the Violin, and on which the wires are pressed with the fingers to produce sound with the action of the Bow, is called Finger-Board.

**Bridge** - That small piece of wood placed on the upper part of the Belly and on which all the wires of the Violin rest, is called Bridge.

**Tail-Piece** - That piece of wood, like the shape of the tongue, just below the Bridge and having four holes, through which the wires reach towards the Pegs, is called Tail-Piece.

**Sound - Holes** - The two big holes like the shape of the letter 'f' on the Belly and on its both sides are called Sound-Holes.

**Button** - A sort of hook below the Belly on which the Tail-Piece remains fixed, is called Button.

**Sound - Post**-That two inches long piece of wood which remains fixed inside the Violin, just below the Bridge and on its right side, and which helps to make the sound of the Violin sweet, and also keeps on supporting the Belly, is called Sound-Post.

**Bass - Bar**-That small piece of wood which remains fixed inside the Violin, just below the Bridge and on its left side, and which keeps on supporting the Belly, is called Bass-Bar.

**Adjusters** - Those small screws of steel which are fixed to the four wires at the Tail-Piece, and which help in adjusting the sound of the four wires to their correct pitches, are called Adjusters.

**Chin - Rest** - That small piece of wood which remains fixed at the top of the Belly and on which the Violin-player usually rests his Chin on the said piece, during the time of playing on Violin, is called Chin-Rest.

**Bow** - A kind of stick having horse-hair with which the Violin is played, is called Bow.

**Rosins** - A kind of solid substance which is rubbed on the hair of the Stick to obtain clear and forceful sound, is called Rosins.

**The Four Wires of Violin**
A Violin has four wires. Generally the four wires are made of steel. The first wire is a little thicker than the remaining three wires and is called Silver-Wire. And the remaining three wires are called Steel-Wires. Some have both the first and second Silver-Wires, the third one Aluminium-Wire and the fourth one Steel-Wire. In European Music the first wire is Steel-Wire and the remaining three wires are of Gut. All the four wires of Violin remain over the Finger-Board.

**Tuning of Violin**
The four wires of Violin are tuned in different 'Swaras'. The first wire is tuned in 'Sa' of the lower Octave, the second wire in 'Pa' of the lower Octave, the third one in 'Sa' of the middle Octave and the fourth one in 'Pa' of the middle Octave, i.e., "`Sa. Pa. Sa Pa`" in this order. Some people tune the four wires in "`Pa. Sa Pa 'Sa`" in this order. In South Indian Music the four wires are tuned in "`Sa. Pa. Sa Pa`" respectively. But in the Western system of music the four wires are tuned in "`Ma Sa Pa Re`" in this order.
