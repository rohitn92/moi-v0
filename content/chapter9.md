## CHAPTER IX
### SHUDDHA and VIKRIT SWARA OR TEEVRA and KOMAL SWARA

It has already been stated that there are seven main notes or standard notes in Hindustani system of music known as "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni". These are known as 'Shuddha-Swaras' or 'Prakrit-Swaras'.

**Shuddha-Swara**-The notes that stand on their originally fixed pitches or natural places in the scale are called 'Shuddha-Swaras', viz., 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni'.

Out of these seven notes 'Sa' and 'Pa' are supposed to be constant or immutable. They do not become affected or changed. They remain fixed in their original pitches and are called 'Achala-Swaras'. The remaining five notes, viz., 'Re Ga Ma Dha Ni' are subject to change and are called 'Chala-Swaras'. When these five notes change their original places in the Scale, they are said to become 'Vikrit' or affected. Since 'Sa and Pa' do not change, therefore they are called 'Avikrit'.

**Vikrit-Swara**-The term 'Vikrit' means affected or changed and 'Vikrit-Swara' means changed note. When the 'Shuddha-Swaras' change their original pitches or natural places in the Scale, or when they are lowered or raised from their original pitches, they are said to become 'Vikrit'. For example, when the sound of 'Re Ga Dha Ni' these four notes is lowered from their original pitches or their natural places in the Scale, they become 'Vikrit' and are called 'Vikrit-Swaras'. In the same way, when the sound of Shuddha 'Ma' is raised from its original pitch or natural place in the Scale, it becomes 'Vikrit' and is called Vikrit 'Ma'.

'Vikrits' are of two kinds: 'Komal-Vikrit' and 'Teevra-Vikrit'.

**Komal-Vikrit**-When the sound of 'Re Ga Dha Ni' these four 'Shuddha' notes is lowered from their original pitches, they are called 'Komal' or 'Komal-Vikrit'.

**Teevra-Vikrit**- When the sound of Shuddha 'Ma' is raised from its original pitch, it is called 'Teevra-Vikrit'.

The following rules regarding 'Vikrit-Swaras' should be remembered :-

(1) 'Sa' and 'Pa' are called 'Achala' or 'Avikrit-Swaras'. They do not become changed or affected. They remain constant and immutable in their original pitches in the Scale.

(2) 'Re Ga Dha Ni' these four notes are subject to change. When their sound is lowered from their original pitches in the Scale, they become 'Vikrit' and on becoming 'Vikrit' they are called 'Komal' or flat notes.

(3) The note 'Ma' also is subject to change. When the sound of 'Ma' is raised from its original pitch in the Scale, it becomes 'Vikrit' and on becoming 'Vikrit' it is called 'Teevra' 'Ma' or sharp 'Ma'.

**Teevra-Swara**-'Teevra-Swara' ordinarily means 'Shuddha-Swara'. The Shuddha notes, excepting Shuddha 'Ma', which are fixed in their original pitches or natural places in the Scale are called 'Teevra-Swaras' or Sharp notes.

**Komal-Swara**-When 'Shudda-Swaras' or Shuddha notes are lowered from their original pitches or natural places in the Scale, they are called 'Komal-Swaras' or flat notes.

It may be noted here that when the sound of 'Shuddha-notes' is lowered from their original pitches, they become 'Komal-Swaras', Now when the sound of these lowered notes is again raised to their natural pitches, they become 'Teevra-Swaras'. For example, if we lower the sound of 'Re Ga Dha Ni' these four notes from their original pitches, they will become 'Komal-Swaras' or flat notes. And if we again raise the sound of these lowered notes to their original pitches, they will become 'Teevra-Swaras' or sharp notes. But it must be particularly noted here that when the sound of Shuddha 'Ma' or Komal 'Ma' is raised from its original pitch it becomes Teevra 'Ma' or sharp 'Ma'. This is the special case with Shuddha 'Ma'. Because the original pitch or the natural place of Shuddha 'Ma' in the Scale is that of a Komal-Swara or flat note. Although 'Ma' is reckoned among the Shuddha-Swaras and is called Shuddha 'Ma' but its natural position in the Scale is like a Komal 'Ma' or flat 'Ma'. While the position of 'Re Ga Dha Ni' these four notes in the Scale is like Teevra-Swaras or sharp notes.

As a matter of fact Shuddha-Swara means the same as Teevra-Swara. All the Shuddha-Swaras, except Shuddha 'Ma', are also called Teevra-Swaras. In other words, leaving aside Shuddha 'Ma' the remaining Shuddha notes 'Re Ga Dha Ni' are also known as Teevra-Swaras. But Shuddha 'Ma' is known as Komal 'Ma'. Then again 'Vikrit' Swara means Komal Swara. Thus leaving aside Komal 'Ma' all the remaining 'Vikrit' Swaras, viz., 'Re_ Ga_ Dha_ Ni_' are called Komal-Swaras. But Vikrit 'Ma' is called Teevra 'Ma'. In a word, Teevra Swaras are also called Shuddha Swaras and Komal Swaras are also called 'Vikrit Swaras'. But Komal 'Ma' is called Shuddha 'Ma' and Teevra 'Ma' is called Vikrit 'Ma'. In English language Komal Swaras are called flat notes and Teevra Swaras are called sharp notes. In common parlance and in Hindi language Teevra Swaras are called Chadhe-Swaras and Komal Swaras are called Utre-Swaras.

From the above description it is clear that there are seven Shuddha Swaras and five Vikrit Swaras. Thus we have in all a series of twelve notes in an Octave thus: `Sa Re_ Re Ga_ Ga Ma Ma' Pa Dha_ Dha Ni_ Ni`. All these twelve notes are used in our Raga system.

The Shuddha and Vikrit Swaras or sharp and flat notes are expressed in writing by means of certain symbols. Shuddha Swaras or sharp notes do not require any symbols to identify them. Komal-Swaras are indicated by putting a short horizontal line or a dash below the notes such as `Re_ Ga_ Dha_ Ni_`. Teevra 'Ma' or sharp 'Ma' is indicated by a short perpendicular line over it, e. g., `Ma'`.

**Note:**- The rule for obtaining Vikrit Swaras is that if two Shrutis are added to every Shuddha Swara, the Vikrit Swara coming after it will be obtained. For example if we add two Shrutis to Shuddha 'Re', which stands on the 5th Shruti, we will get the position of Vikrit 'Ga', coming just after Shuddha 'Re', on the 7th Shruti. And this is the correct position of Vikrit 'Ga'. Again if we add two Shrutis to Shuddha 'Ma' which stands on the 10th Shruti, we will get the position of Vikrit 'Ma', which comes just after Shuddha 'Ma', on the 12th Shruti. And this is the correct position of Vikrit 'Ma' or Teevra 'Ma'. Similarly other 'Vikrit' Swaras can be obtained by applying this rule.
