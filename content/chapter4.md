### SHRUTI SWARA AND SAPTAK

#### SHRUTI

The term 'Shruti' is a Sanskrit word. It is derived from the root 'SHRU' (श्र) which means 'to hear'. And 'Shruti' means that which can be heard. Our writers on music have defined 'Shruti' in a very simple way thus: "Shruyate Iti Shruti" (श्रूयते इति श्रुति) which means any sound capable of being heard is called 'Shruti'. This definition of Shruti seems to be very simple. But from the musical point of view it is not possible to give such a wide connotation to the word 'Shruti'. Because music is concerned with that sound alone which is capable of being used in music and not any kind of sound. Besides, the term 'Shruti' connotes that sound which can be distinctly identified by the ear. So we will have to restrict the meaning of 'Shruti' to the above said two conditions. Therefore in order to under-stand the correct definition of 'Shruti' the following properties should be remembered :

(1) Sound which is capable of being used in music.
(2) Sound which can be clearly heard.
(3) Sound which can be distinctly identified by the ear.

**Definition of Shruti :** That sound which is capable of being used in music and which can be distinctly identified by the ear is called 'Shruti'. In other words, musical sounds which can be clearly heard and distinguished one from the other are called 'Shrutis'. In short, every distinct and audible musical sound is called 'Shruti'.

The definition of 'Shruti' given in the Sanskrit book entitled 'Abhinava Raga Manjari' is as under:

> नित्यं गीतोपयोगित्वमभिज्ञेयत्वमप्युत ।
> लक्ष्ये प्रोक्तं सुपर्याप्तं संगीतं श्रुति लक्षणम् ।।
>
> Nityam Geetopayogitwam Bhigyeatwam Pyatu,
> Lakshyae Proktam Supariyaptam Sangeet Shruti Lakshanam.

**Explanation:** That sound which is capable of being used in music and which can be distinctly identified by the ear is called 'Shruti'.

As a matter of fact both 'Shruti' and 'Swara' are musical sounds capable of being heard. The distinction between the two is something like that which exists between the snake and its coil or between gold and the ornaments made out of it. All 'Shrutis' are capable of being used as 'Swaras' in various Ragas. The Shrutis that are actually used in a particular Raga become 'Swaras' for that Raga and those that are not used in that Raga remain 'Shrutis' only. 'Swaras' or notes are musical sounds at large intervals while 'Shrutis' are musical sounds at very small intervals between two consecutive notes and are known as microtones.

#### SWARA

Musical sound which is sweet by itself is called 'Swara'. In other words, every sound that by itself creates a charming sensation on the ear is musical and is called 'Swara' or note.

> स्वयं यो राजते नादः स स्वर परिकीर्तितः
>
> \- 'संगीत दर्पण'
>
> Swayam Yo Rajte Nada Sa Swara Parkeertita.
>
> \- 'Sangeet Darpan'

**Explanation:** That musical sound which is sweet by itself is called 'Swara'.

Pandit Sharangdeva the writer of 'Sangeet Ratnakar' defines 'Swara' in the following manner :-

> श्रुत्यन्तर भावी यः स्निग्धो ऽनुरणनात्मकः ।
> स्वतो रञ्जयति श्रोतृचिन्तं स स्वर उच्यते ।।

**Explanation:**-- Musical sound which is continuous and uniform and which by itself creates a charming sensation on the ear is called Swara.

From the above definition of 'Swara' it is clear that our Sanskrit writers have laid down two necessary conditions for the definition of 'Swara', namely 'ANURANAN' or continuity and 'SNIGDHATA' or uniformity in the timbre of sound. Therefore in order to understand the correct definition of Swara the following conditions must be remembered :-

(1) Sound capable of being used in music.
(2) Sound must be continuous and uniform.
(3) Sound must be sweet by itself.

**Definition of 'Swara':**- That musical sound which is continuous and uniform and which by itself creates a charming sensation on the ear is called 'Swara'. In other words, that musical sound which is sweet by itself and which creates a charming sensation on the ear is called 'Swara'.

It may be said here that just as every hue or tint which produces a startling effect or dazzling impression on the eye, is treated as preferential colour, in the same way every sound that by itself creates a charming sensation on the ear is musical and is called 'Swara' or note. On the other hand just as every dark and heavy pigment is generally pronounced to be dull and ugly in the same way every sound which is not musical hurts the ear and is called 'Apaswara' or noise.

Having gone through the definition of 'Shruti' and 'Swara' we should know that all the writers on music, both ancient and modern, are unanimously agreed that there are twentytwo 'Shrutis' in an Octave, i.e. from 'Sa' of the middle Octave to 'Sa' of the higher Octave, with their well known ancient names Teevra, Kumudwati etc. And these twenty-two 'Shrutis' have been divided into seven 'Shuddha-Swaras'.

In Hindustani system of music there are seven main 'Swaras' known as Shadja, Rishabha, Gandhara, Madhyama, Panchama, Dhaivata and Nishada. These are named in practice by their initial syllables as "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni". In European music these are known as "C D E F G A B" and in Italian music these are called "Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si". Our music consists of seven 'Shuddha Swaras' and five shifted notes known as 'Vikrit-Swaras'. Thus we have twelve notes in all in the complete music scale of the present day. The seven standard notes or 'Shuddha-Swaras' have been located on the twenty two 'Shrutis' according to the famous Sanskrit Rule known as:

> चतुश्चतुश्चतुश्चैव षड्ज मध्यम पंचमाः ।
> द्वंद्वे निषाद गांधारौ त्रिस्त्री ऋषभ धैवतौ ।।

**Explanation:**- The notes 'Sa', 'Ma and 'Pa' carry four Shrutis each, 'Ga' and 'Ni' two 'Shrutis' each and 'Re' and 'Dha' three 'Shrutis' each.

This principle of locating the Shuddha-Swaras on the 'Shrutis' has been followed by both the ancient and modern writers. They unanimously accept the above quoted famous rule for the distribution of 'Shrutis' among the seven Shuddha-Swaras. But they differ with regard to the method of location of the notes on the 'Shrutis'. In order to understand this difference between the two we should know that our writers on music have been divided into three groups, viz. (1) The ancient writers who flourished before the 15th century, chief among them being Sri Bharat and Pandit Sharangdeva. (2) The medieval writers of the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries named Lochan, Hrdaya Narain Deva, Shriniwas etc. and (3) The writers of the 19th and 20th centuries, chief among them being Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande. The ancient and medieval writers fix their Shuddha-Swaras on the last 'Shruti' i.e. their notes become manifest on the last 'Shruti'; while the modern writers fix their notes on the first 'Shruti'. This is the chief difference between the two said writers as regards the location of notes on 'Shrutis'. The Shuddha-Swaras of both the ancient and medieval writers are located on the twenty-two 'Shrutis' thus: 'Sa' stands on the 4th 'Shruti', 'Re' on the 7th 'Shruti', 'Ga' on the 9th 'Shruti', 'Ma' on the 13th 'Shruti' 'Pa' on the 17th 'Shruti', 'Dha' on the 20th 'Shruti' and 'Ni' on the 22nd 'Shruti'. On the other hand the Shuddha-Swaras of the modern writers are located on the twenty-two 'Shrutis' thus; 'Sa' stands on the 1st 'Shruti'. 'Re' on the 5th 'Shruti', 'Ga' on the 8th 'Shruti', 'Ma' on the 10th 'Shruti' 'Pa' on the 14th 'Shruti', 'Dha' on the 18th 'Shruti' and 'Ni' on the 21st 'Shruti'. In other words, the ancient and medieval writers have fixed their seven Shuddha-Swaras 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni' on 4th, 7th, 9th, 13th, 17th, 20th and 22nd 'Shrutis' respectively; while the modern writers have fixed their seven Shuddha-Swaras 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni' on the 1st, 5th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th and 21st 'Shrutis' respectively.

**NOTE**- A glance at the comparative table showing the location of 'Shuddha' notes of the ancient and modern writers will clearly show that the position of the seven 'Shuddha' notes of the modern writers are quite different from those of the ancient writers. The reason is that the ancient writers fix their 'Swaras' on the ultimate 'Shruti' while the modern writers fix their 'Swaras' on the first 'Shruti'. For example, the 'Sa' of the modern writers is on the first Shruti while the 'Sa' of the ancient writers is on the fourth 'Shruti'.

#### SAPTAK
The entire group of seven notes, 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni', taken from one end to the other is called 'Saptak'.

In order to understand the full connotation of 'Saptak' it will be convenient to know something about 'Sthana' or 'Voice Register'. According to the pitch of sound, Hindustani Music recognises three 'Sthanas' or 'Voice Registers' known as 'Mandra-Sthana', 'Madhya-Sthana' and 'Tara-Sthana'. 'Sthana' and Saptak' are one and the same thing. The voice of 'Mandra-Sthana' or Voce-di-Petto is said to be produced in the chest, the voice of 'Madhya-Sthana' or voce-di- Falsetto is said to be produced by the throat and the voice of 'Tara-Sthana' is said to be produced by the head.

(Continuation of Chapter IV)

...the voice of 'Madhya-Sthana' or voce-di- Falsetto is said to be produced by the throat and the voice of 'Tara-Sthana' is said to be produced by the head. Thus these three 'Voice-Registers' originate from the chest, the throat and the head respectively. Each Voice-Register is actually an Octave higher than the preceding one. These three Voice-Registers, are also known as 'Mandra-Saptak', 'Madhya-Saptak' and 'Tara-Saptak respectively.

**Mandra-Saptak**-That 'Saptak' whose sound is doubly lower than the sound of the notes of 'Madhya-Saptak' is called 'Mandra-Saptak'. It is also known as the lower 'Voice-Register' or the lower 'Saptak'.

**Madhya-Saptak**-That 'Saptak' whose sound is of medium pitch or is doubly higher than the sound of the notes of 'Mandra-Saptak', is called 'Madhya-Saptak'. It is also known as the Middle 'Voice-Register' or the middle 'Saptak'.

**Tara-Saptak**-That 'Saptak' whose sound is doubly higher than the sound of the notes of 'Madhya-Saptak' is called 'Tara-Saptak'. It is also known as the higher 'Voice-Register or the higher 'Saptak'.

It can also be said that the 'Saptak' which produces the normal voice is called 'Madhya-Saptak'. The voice produced by 'Mandra-Saptak' is doubly lower than the voice of 'Madhya-Saptak' and the voice of 'Tara-Saptak' is doubly higher than the voice of 'Madhya-Saptak'.

It may be noted here that normally the range of human voice is about three Octaves, i.e. from about 87 vibrations per second to 768 vibrations per second. But certain remarkable voices have been heard to go so slow as to reach 40 vibrations per second or to reach a high note of 2048 vibrations per second. The range of human voice for the perception of a musical tone is from 32 to 33768 vibrations per second. It is interesting to note that the lowest audible sound has only 16 vibrations per second and the highest audible sound has 38000 vibrations per second giving a range of about eleven Octaves.

The notes of the above three 'Saptaks' are expressed in writing by means of certain symbols. The notes of 'Mandra-Saptak' are indicated by putting a dot below the notes, such as `Pa. Dha. Ni.`. The notes of 'Madhya-Saptak' do not require any symbols. These are indicated without adding or attaching any symbols to them such as 'Ga Ma Pa'. The notes of 'Tara-Saptak' are indicated by putting a dot over the notes, such as `'Sa 'Re 'Ga`.

**The notes of Mandra-Saptak**
`Sa. Re. Ga. Ma. Pa. Dha. Ni.`

**The notes of Madhya-Saptak**
`Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni`

**The notes of Tara-Saptak**
`'Sa 'Re 'Ga 'Ma 'Pa 'Dha 'Ni`
