### Definitions of some Musical Terms

**Alankar**-The specific pattern of a certain group of notes is known as Alankar. For example, "`Sa Re Ga, Re Ga Ma, Ga Ma Pa,`" or "`Sa Re Sa Re Ga, Re Ga Re Ga Ma, Ga Ma Ga Ma Pa`" etc. Alankar is also called 'Palta'. 'Alankaras' and 'Paltas' are one and the same thing. 'Alankaras' are found both in ascent and descent. 'Alankaras' help a great deal to achieve clear expression and correct intonation of every note.

The term Alankar literally means ornament or embellishment. Just as ornaments are meant for enhancing the beauty of a woman, in the same way 'Alankaras' are meant for creating beauty in singing a Raga or playing them on an Instrument.

> शशिना रहितेव निशा विजलेव नदी लता विपुष्पेव ।
> अवभूषितो कान्ता गीतिरलंकार हीना स्यात् ।।
>
> \- 'अभिनव राग मंजरी'
>
> Shashina Rahiteva Nisha Vijleva Nadi Lata Vipushpeva,
> Anubhushito Kanta Geetirlankar heena Syat.

**Explanation** Just as a night without moon, a river without water and a woman without ornaments do not look beautiful, in the same way a song without 'Alankaras' has no beauty.

Alankaras or 'Paltas' should be learnt and practised very well before beginning to learn a song or to play a 'Gat' on an Instrument. No attempt should be made to learn a song without thoroughly preparing a fairly large number of Alankaras. When Alankaras have been well prepared, only then a song or 'Gat' should be learnt. Those who begin to learn a song or 'Gat' without mastering the 'Alankaras' at first, they commit a great blunder. Because without having a rigorous training in Alankaras, at the initial stage, students of music cannot render a song or 'Gat' in clear expression and in correct intonation. Besides, their foundation or groundwork becomes weak which is likely to damage their voice, and hinder their future progress. Dexterous practice of 'Alankaras' greatly help the students in acquiring strength, steadiness and correct pitch-sense in their voice and breath control. Besides, by assiduous practice of 'Alankaras' the students acquire speed and accuracy of intonation in singing 'Tanas' or 'Todas'. In fact, Alankaras are equally important both for vocalists and Instrumentalists. To a vocalist 'Alankaras help in training his voice and improving his method of execution; while to an Instrumentalist Alankaras help in developing finger-skill and in acquiring speed and accuracy of intonation. Therefore Alankaras are almost a sine-qua-non to every student of music.

**Tana**-'Tana' is a slow or rapid succession of notes intonated in different forms or styles meant for developing a Raga. 'Tanas' may also be defined as open voiced running passages of notes in quick tempo. For example: "`'Sa Re Ga Ma Ga Re Sa, Pa Dha Ni 'Sa 'Ni Dha Pa, 'Sa Re Ga Ma Ga Re Sa Ni. Dha. Pa. Ma. Ga. Re. Sa. Ni. Sa.`"

'Tanas' consist of several notes. While singing Tanas or playing them on Instruments, attention has to be paid to the Ascent and Descent, the Vadi and Samvadi and the deleted notes of a Raga. 'Tanas' are usually set in different 'Layas' or rhythms such as 'Dugun' (double the speed of a given 'Laya'), 'Chougun' (four times the speed of a given 'Laya') and 'Athgun' (eight times the speed of a given 'Laya') 'Layas'. When a Tana is sung in the same speed as that of the song or 'Gat' of a Raga, it is called "Barabar-ki-Tana"; when a Tana is sung in twice the speed of the song or 'Gat', it is called 'Dugun-ki-Tana'; when a Tana is sung in four times the speed of the song or 'Gat', it is called 'Chougun-ki-Tana', and when a Tana is sung in eight times the speed of the song or 'Gat', it is called 'Athgun-ki-Tana'.

Tanas are sung in Khyal, Tappa, Thumri and in every other kinds of songs. But Tanas are not used in Dhrupad singing.

**Shuddha Tana**-A Tana which takes the notes in a serial order or a Tana which is set in the form of straight ascent and descent, is called 'Shuddha Tana' or 'Sapat Tana' or 'Saral Tana', e. g., `Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni 'Sa 'Ni Dha Pa Ma Ga Re Sa` or `Dha Ni 'Sa 'Re 'Ga 'Re 'Sa Ni Dha Pa Ma Ga Re Sa`.

**Koot Tana**-A Tana which takes the notes in an irregular order or in a zigzag way or the Tana whose notes are not in a serial order both in the ascent and descent, is called 'Koot Tana', e. g., "`Sa Re Ga Re Ma Pa Ma Ga, Re Ga Ma Pa Dha 'Sa Dha Pa, Ma Pa Dha 'Sa 'Re 'Sa, Dha Ni Pa Ma Pa Ma Ga Ma, Re Ga Re Ma Ga Re Sa Sa`".

**Mishra Tana**-A Tana which is a mixture of 'Shuddha Tana' and 'Koot Tana', is called Mishra Tana, e.g., `'Ni 'Sa Ga Ma Pa Dha Pa Ma, Ga Ma Dha Ni 'Sa 'Re 'Sa Ni, Dha Ni 'Sa 'Re Ga Ma 'Sa Ni Dha Pa Ma Ga Re Sa`. In this Tana the notes of the first half of the Tana are in a zigzag form and the notes of the remaining half of the Tana are in a serial order. Thus, it is a mixture of 'Shuddha Tana' and 'Koot Tana'. Such a Tana is called 'Mishra Tana'.

**Gamaka-Tana** A 'Tana' in which the notes are sung with the use of Gamakas, is called 'Gamaka-Tana'. In other words, when the notes of a Tana are pronounced with some shake or quiver, it is known as Gamak-Tana.

**Alankarik - Tana** - A 'Tana' which is composed of 'Alankars' or 'Paltas', is called 'Alankarik-Tana'. For example,
`Sa Re Sa Ga Re Sa, Ni. Sa Ni. Re Sa Ni., Dha. Ni. Dha. Sa Ni. Dha., Pa. Dha. Pa. Ni. Dha. Pa., Ma Pa Ma Dha Pa Ma, Ga Ma Ga Pa Ma Ga, Re Ga Re Ma Ga Re, Sa Re Sa Ga Re Sa.`

**Meend**-'Meend' is defined as a graceful transition from one note to another without silencing the voice or without breaking the continuity of sound. In other words, to connect two, three or four notes gracefully without breaking the continuity of voice or sound is called 'Meend'. For example, a Meend over `'Dha 'Ni 'Sa`. Here, these three notes are to be pronounced or connected gracefully without silencing the voice. In Sitar when two, three or four notes are played by striking the wire and pulling it up to the desired note, smoothly and gracefully without breaking the continuity of sound, it is called 'Meend'. For example, a Meend over `Ga Ma Pa`. In order to play `Ga Ma Pa` through Meend we will at first place the left hand finger on the fret of 'Ga', then will strike the main wire with the right hand finger having a plectrum (Mizrab) and produce the sound of 'Ga' and then will pull the wire smoothly on the fret of 'Ga' until it reaches the sound of 'Pa' without breaking the continuity of sound and at the same time sounding 'Ma' the intermediary note. In this way `Ga Ma Pa` is shown through 'Meend'. This kind of 'Meend' has the upward movement. Another kind of 'Meend' has a downward movement. For example, a Meend from `Pa` to `Ga`. In this 'Meend' we first pull the main wire with the left hand finger on the fret of 'Ga' up to the sound of 'Pa', then we strike the wire with the plectrum and produce the sound of 'Pa' and then move the wire smoothly and gracefully up to 'Ga' without breaking the continuity of sound. Thus, `Pa` to `Ga` is produced through 'Meend'.

While playing 'Meend' a kind of tension is created in the main wire. When the 'Meend' passes in the upward direction, tension in the wire increases and when it passes in the downward direction, tension in the wire decreases. 'Meend' plays an important part in music. It is of great aesthetic value in music. 'Meend' is a speciality of 'Sitar'. It has a distinct effect and is a favourite ornament with all the 'Sitar' players.

**Gamak or Tonal Variation** - When a note is pronounced or played on an Instrument with some shake or quiver, it is called Gamak. In other words, swinging of notes which pleases the listeners is called Gamak. In fact, Gamak is a comprehensive term and includes not only the shake or quiver of notes but also other manipulations of notes, such as merging a note skilfully into another note, free swinging of notes, gliding over the notes etc., which produce a pleasing and charming sensation on the ear. There are as many as fifteen kinds of Gamakas mentioned in the 'Granthas' (Books on music) but only ten of them are used and each one is produced in a different way. The purpose of Gamak is to embellish a Raga. In Sitar Gamak is played by placing the left hand finger on the fret of any note, sounding that note with some shake or quiver of the main wire and then merging into another note with the same shake or quiver.

**Soot or Ghaseet**-'Soot' or 'Ghaseet' is defined as a graceful transition from one note to another by a glide over the notes smoothly and gracefully, without breaking the continuity of sound. 'Ghaseet' is played on 'Sitar'. The same action on Sarod, Violin and Sarangi is called 'Soot'. Ghaseet may be of three or four or even more notes. e.g. 'Pa Dha Ni' or 'Pa Dha Ni 'Sa'. While playing 'Pa Dha Ni 'Sa' on Sitar in 'Ghaseet', we will put the index finger of the left hand on the fret of 'Pa', then will strike the main wire with the right hand finger having the plectrum and produce the sound of 'Pa' and then will move the left hand's index finger, swiftly and smoothly, by a glide over 'Dha' and 'Ni' until it reaches the fret of 'Sa' without breaking the continuity of sound and at the same time sounding 'Dha' and 'Ni' the intermediary notes. The whole action should be perfectly smooth and graceful.

In 'Violin' when two or three notes are played with a glide over the notes, smoothly and gracefully, without breaking the continuity of sound and with one action of the bow, it is called 'Soot'. For example, to play 'Dha Ni 'Sa' through 'Soot' on the 'Violin' we will place the finger on 'Dha', then we will strike the wire with the bow and produce the sound of 'Dha' and move the finger smoothly until it reaches the sound of 'Sa', without breaking the continuity of sound and at the same time sounding 'Ni' the intermediary note. In this way, 'Dha Ni 'Sa' will be produced through 'Soot' on the Violin. 'Soot' and 'Ghaseet' are one and the same thing. The difference between the two is that 'Soot' is played on Sarod, Violin, Israj and Sarangi while 'Ghaseet' is played on Sitar. 'Soot' plays an important part in music. It has a definite effect. It is also a favourite ornamentation with the Violin players.

**Kan**-'Kan' means grace note. Before pronouncing a particular note when another note, preceding or succeeding that particular note, is slightly touched or suggested then the slightly touched note is called 'Kan'. For example, `<sup>Ma</sup>Pa`. Here, 'Pa' is the main note to be pronounced. Before pronouncing it 'Ma', the preceding note, has been slightly touched. Thus, 'Ma' becomes the 'Kan' or the grace note on 'Pa' or the 'Kan' of 'Ma' on 'Pa'.

**Kampan**-To sound a note with very slight shake or quiver is called 'Kampan' or trill. In order to produce this action, on Sitar we will place the left hand finger on the fret of any note, strike the main wire with the plectrum and sound the note with a little shake or quiver of the wire to and fro. This action is called 'Kampan' or Trill.

**Krintan** - 'Krintan' is mostly played on Sitar. It is generally displayed while playing 'Jhala'. For example, '`Ga Ma Ga Re Sa`'. Here, we will first place the second finger of the left hand on 'Ga', strike the wire with the plectrum and produce the sound of a Ga and without breaking the continuity of sound will place the third finger of the left hand on 'Ma' and then will touch 'Re' with the finger of the left hand and leave it. This action will produce 'Krintan'. Krintan may be of two notes also, e.g., to produce 'Sa Ni' in one stroke.

**Khatka**-'Khatka' is defined as a sort of trill or quick alteration of notes. When a note is played twice in quick alteration, sounding its lower and upper notes, it is called Khatka, e.g., `<sup>Dha Ma</sup>Pa Pa` or '`Dha Pa Ma Pa`'. It is also known as "the notes within the brackets", e. g, `(Pa)`. Here, in order to sing or play `(Pa)` first the 'Kan' of 'Dha' will be taken, then the note 'Pa' will be pronounced or played, then again the 'Kan' of 'Ma' will be taken and lastly 'Pa' will be sung or played again. In this way, 'Khatka' is played on Sitar.

**Zamzama**-Zamzama is also a kind of technical action which is displayed on Sitar. When two notes are played on Sitar, one after another, repeatedly and in quick succession with one stroke of the plectrum, a kind of quivering sound is produced which is called zamzama. Zamzama is mainly played on Sitar on two frets and with the help of two fingers. The index finger of the left hand remains fixed on the first fret and the middle finger remains in action by lifting and dropping the finger on the second fret, and the two together produce a sweet and quivering sound called Zamzama. For example:
`Ga Ma Ma Ma`
`RaS SS SS SS`
Supposing 'Ga Ma' these two notes are to be played as zamzama. First, keep the index finger of the left hand on the fret of 'Ga', strike the main wire forcibly with the plectrum and produce the sound of 'Ga' and keep the finger fixed on the fret of 'Ga' and then gently touch 'Ma' with the middle finger and lift it and drop it again and again in quick succession. By so doing a sort of sweet and quivering sound will be produced which is called Zamzama.

**Thonk**-Thonk is another technical action employed in Sitar. It is played just before playing 'Jhala'. It may be called a kind of Gamaka according to Dr. S. N. Ratanjankar. After playing Alap and Gat-Toda on Sitar when the tempo increases, 'Thonk' is played with the help of plectrum. As a matter of fact, when several notes are played together in one stroke of the plectrum, the effect so produced therefrom is also called 'Thonk'. In other words, the graceful effect produced by playing several notes in only one stroke of the plectrum, be it 'Da' or 'Ra', is called 'Thonk'.

**Jhala**-Jhala is a sort of rhythmic pattern produced on Sitar by playing the 'boles' like Da Ra Ra Ra, Da Ra Ra Ra, Da Ra Ra Da Ra Ra Da Ra etc. on the main wire and Chikari-ka-Tar in rhythmic variations. There are two kinds of Jhalas. The one is called straight Jhala or 'Seedha-Jhala' and the other is called reverse Jhala or 'Ulta-Jhala'. In straight Jhala the 'boles' 'Da Ra Ra Ra' are played while in reverse Jhala the 'boles' 'Ra Da Ra Ra' are played. Jhala is mostly played in fast Gats. It is played at the end of Gat-Toda. Jhala is an ornamentation of Sitar. It is very important in Sitar.

(Continuation of Chapter XI)

**Alap**-'Alap' is defined as a form of musical progression which aims at developing and embellishing a Raga. In other words, it is the rhapsodical embellishment of a Raga. In Alap there is a rhythmic advance by determinate degrees. It is executed in a slow speed or 'Vilambit Laya'. In Alap proper attention is paid to all the notes of a Raga. But the dominent notes receive special prominence both in magnitude and time. Alap is usually done in four parts, viz., 'Sthai' (the first part), Antara (the second part), Sanchari (the third part) and Abhog the fourth part. The Alap of 'Sthai' is developed in the lower and middle octave. The Alap of 'Antara starts from Ga, Ma or Pa of the middle octave and goes up to 'Ga' of the higher octave. In 'Sanchari' various Gamakas, Meend-work etc. are displayed. It is confined to the middle octave. In Abhog a singer can go up to any note in the higher octave, according to his liking but under the rules of the Raga concerned. In Alap every 'Tan' ends on the tonic note (Sa) where the 'Sam' is shown. In Sitar the Alap of a Raga is done through the frequent use of various 'Meends', glides and Gamakas etc. using the boles of 'Da' and 'Ra'.

**Jod**-'Jod' is different from Alap. It is played on Sitar. It is generally played after the Alap-work. In 'Jod' the development of a Raga is done in a medium speed. As a matter of fact, when the development of a Raga is done employing 'Meends', Gamakas' etc., in a medium speed, it is called 'Jod'. The main difference between 'Alap' and 'Jod' is that 'Alap' is played in slow speed and 'Jod' is played in medium speed. 'Jod' is usually rendered in two parts, viz, 'Sthai' and 'Antara'.

**Badhat**-The progression of notes or the development of a Raga on certain recognised principles is called 'Badhat'. The 'Badhat' of a Raga is done by determinate degrees. It is executed first to a slow, then to a medium and finally to a fast measure. In 'Badhat' the prominent notes of a Raga receive special attention. 'Badhat' of a Raga is done in four successive stages. viz., 'Sthai', 'Antara', 'Sanchari' and Abhog. 'Badhat' starts from the 'Vadi' note of a Raga. Gradually other salient notes receive prominence both in magnitude and time. Badhat, at first, extends over two or three notes. Gradually other notes are added. Then it gradually grows longer and the Raga is fully elaborated.

**Chhoot**--To sing or to play on any Instrument one or more than one note in two different octaves, one after another, in quick succession is called 'Chhoot'. For example, `'Sa Sa.`, `'Ga Ga`, `'Ga 'Ga Re Sa Ga Ga Re Sa` `'Ga Re Sa Ga Re Sa` etc. 'Chhoot' is also known as 'Pukar'. In order to play `'Ga 'Ga Re Sa Ga Ga Re Sa` on sitar we will first play Ga Ga Re Sa, either on the frets or through 'Meend', in the higher octave and immediately after that will play Ga Ga Re Sa in the Middle octave. Again, to play `'Pa Pa.` as Chhoot, we will at first produce the sound of 'Pa' of the lower octave and will come on 'Pa' of the middle octave by gliding the left hand finger quickly and gracefully up to 'Pa' without producing the sound of any other intermediary notes.

**Pakad**-The specific pattern of notes which, when sung or played on any Instruments, by itself indicates a Raga is called Pakad or the catch notes. For example, '`Ga_, Sa Re_ Sa`' this combination of notes indicates Raga Bhairavi.

**Uchchara**-The term 'Uchchara' literally means pronunciation. But in the context of Raga it connotes the correct intonation and correct rendering of a note in the Raga both in its pitch and expression. For example, the notes 'Re' and 'Dha' in Raga Bhairava are pronounced with oscillations, while in Raga Kalingda the two notes are sung plainly. Similarly, 'Ga' and 'Ni' of Raga Bimpalasi are sung with Meends or oscillations, while in Raga Dhanashri the two notes are sung without Meends or oscillations. This, in short, is known as 'Uchchara.'

**Vakra-Swara**-'Vakra-Swara' means crooked note or the turning note. It is the note at which the ascent and descent take a zigzag course. If we start from a particular note, either in the ascent or descent, in order to reach a desired note and instead of going straight away to the desired note we make a turn, or descend from a note in the middle, to the next lower note and then leaving it aside reach the desired note, then the turning note will be called 'Vakra-Swara'. For example, in the combination '`Pa Dha Ni Dha 'Sa`' the note 'Ni' is 'Vakra-Swara'. Because, in the said combination instead of going straight away from 'Pa' to 'Sa' we made a turn from 'Ni' to the next lower note 'Dha' and leaving it aside reached 'Sa'. Therefore, here, 'Ni' the turning note is the 'Vakra-Swara' or crooked note. Again, in the combination '`Ga Re Ma Ga`', 'Re' is 'Vakra-Swara'. Similarly, in the combination '`Re Ga Re Ma Ga`', 'Ga' is the 'Vakra-Swara'.

**Lakshangeet** - 'Lakshangeet' is a definition song describing in some detail the properties of the Raga in which it is composed. For example the 'Lakshangeet' of Raga Bhairavi is as under:

**Sthai**
> Bhairavi Kahi Manmani
> Komal Sab Sur Kar Guni Gawat.

**Antra**
> Madhyam 'Vadi' Sur 'Samvadi'
> Bhakti Ras Ki Khani
> Sab Koi Gawat Sab Ko Rijhawat
> Bhairavi Shastra Pramani.

Here in the above song the properties of Raga Bhairavi, namely (1) All Komal notes. (2) Sampurna Jati, (3) Time of singing (4) Ma Vadi and 'Sa' 'Samvadi' have been shown and the song is intonated in Raga Bhairavi. Therefore, such a song which describes the properties of a Raga and is also set in the notes of that Raga is called 'Lakshangeet'.

**Poorva - Raga** - The Ragas that are sung or played on any Instrument between midday and midnight are called Poorva Ragas.

**Uttar-Raga** - The Ragas that are sung or played on any Instrument between midnight and midday are called Uttar-Ragas.

**Poorvangavadi-Raga** - Those Ragas which have their vadi note in the first part of the octave, viz., 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa' are called Poorvangavadi-Ragas. For example, Raga Yaman is a Poorvangavadi-Raga as its vadi note 'Ga' is in the first part of the octave.

**Uttarangawadi - Raga** - Those Ragas which have their vadi note in the second part of the octave, viz., 'Ma Pa Dha Ni 'Sa' are called Uttarangavadi-Ragas. For example, Asawari is an Uttarangawadi-Raga as its vadi note 'Dha' is in the second part of the octave.

**Gat**-A set musical composition consisting of the syllables or boles like "`Dir Da Dir Da Ra Da Da Ra`" or "`Da Dir Dir Dir Dar Dar Da Da`" etc. and having Sthai and Antra as two parts and which is played on Sitar and Sarod, is called 'Gat'. 'Gats' are of two kinds: (a) Maseetkhani-Gat and (b) Razakhani-Gat. Maseetkhani-Gat is also known as vilambit-Gat or Delhi-Baj-Gat' and Razakhani-Gat is also known as Poorab-Baj-Gat or Drut-Gat or Lucknavi-Baj-Gat.

**Maseetkhani-Gat** - That Gat which consists of the syllables or boles of "`Dir Da Dir Da Ra Da Da Ra`" and which is played in slow tempo or speed, is called Maseetkhani-Gat. This kind of Gat is generally played with the special use of Meends, glides and various other embellishments. It is of sober nature. In this kind of Gat variety of Tanas or Todas are played in four times or eight times the speed of the Gat.

**Razakhani-Gat** - That Gat which consists of the syllables or boles of "`Da Dir Dir Dir Dar Dar Da Da`" and which is played in fast tempo or speed is called Razakhani-Gat. In this kind of Gat the Tanas or Todas are played in twice the speed of the Gat.

There is also a third variety of Gat known as "**Madhya-laya-Ki-Gat**" or the Gat of medium tempo or speed. This variety of Gat consists of the same kind of syllables or boles as that of the Razakhani-Gat but it is played in medium speed or in-between the speed of Maseetkhani and Razakani Gats. In this kind of Gat the Todas are usually played in twice the speed of the Gat. The composition of this kind of Gat is such as it appears beautiful only when it is played in the medium tempo.

Another varity of Gat is known as '**Amirkhani-Gat**'. The syllables or boles of this kind of Gat are exactly like that of the Maseetkhani-Gat but it is played in a simple way without the use of Meends and Glides and, besides, it is played in the medium speed. In this kind of Gat the Todas are played in twice the speed of the Gat.

**Toda** - Todas are the slow or rapid succession of notes intonated in different forms or styles meant for developing a Raga. For example: "`Ga Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni 'Sa 'Ni Dha Pa Ma Ga Re Sa`" when played with boles like "`Da Re Da Ra Da Ra Da Ra Da Ra Da`". Tanas and Todas are one and the same thing. When a Tana is played on Sitar or Sarod, it is called Toda and when the same Tana is sung, it is called a Tana.

**Barabar-Ka-Toda** - When a Toda is played in the same speed as that of the Gat, it is called Barabar-ka-Toda.

**Dugun-Ka-Toda** - When a Toda is played in twice the speed of the Gat, it is called Dugun-Ka-Toda. In other words, to play two notes in one unit of time and in the same speed is called Dugun-Ka-Toda.

**For Example:**
<pre>
  1                                     
  Ga Ma    Dha Ni_    'Sa 'Re    'Ga 'Re
  Da Ra    Da Ra      Da Ra      Da Ra  
  O                                     
  'Sa Ni_   Dha_ Pa   Ma_ Ga_    Re_ Sa     Ga
  Da Ra    Da Ra      Da Ra      Da Ra      Da
  3                                      X
</pre>

**Chougun - Ka - Toda** - When a Toda is played in four times the speed of the Gat, it is called Chougun-Ka-Toda. In other words, to play four notes in one unit of time and in the same speed is called Chougun-Ka-Toda.

**For example:**
<pre>
  1
  Ni_ Sa Ga Ma   Pa Dha Pa Ma
  Da Ra Da Ra    Da Ra Da Ra
  O
  Ga Ma Dha Ni_  'Sa 'Re 'Sa Ni_   Dha Ni_ 'Sa 'Re
  Da Ra Da Re    Da Ra Da Ra     Da Ra Da Ra
  3
  'Ga 'Re Sa Ni_  Dha Pa Ma Ga    Re Sa Ni_ Sa      Pa
  Da Ra Da Ra    Da Ra Da Ra     Da Ra Da Ra       Da
                                                 X
</pre>
**Note:**-In Sitar Todas are generally played in Dugun, Chougun and Athgun Layas. In Maseetkhani-Gats the Todas are played in Chougun and Athgun Layas. In Razakhani-Gats Todas are played in Dugun Laya. Sometimes, these are also played in Barabar-ki-Laya, i.e., in the same speed as that of the Gat.

**Laya**-An uniform speed of a given time is called 'Laya'. For example, if we count from 1 to 5, we will do so in an uniform speed pronouncing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In doing so we will neither stop in the middle nor make the speed alternately slow and fast but will go on counting 1 to 5 in perfectly uniform speed. Just as a watch or clock gives the sound of "Tik Tik Tik Tik" in an uniform manner, in the same way the uniformity of speed is maintained in singing and playing of Instruments. This very uniform speed is called 'Laya' or tempo.

**Vilambit-Laya**-The laya or tempo which is very slow is called Vilambit-Laya. It is also known as 'Thai' or Thai-ki-Laya.

**Drut-Laya**-The Laya or tempo which is very fast or which is four times as fast as the speed of Vilambit Laya is called 'Drut-Laya'.

**Madhya-Laya**-The Laya or tempo which is in-between the speed of Vilambit-Laya and Drut-Laya, is called 'Madhya-Laya'. In other words, the Laya which is twice as fast as the speed of Vilambit-Laya or twice as slow as the speed of Drut-Laya, is called Madhya-Laya or Medium tempo.

**Ati-Vilambit-Laya**-The speed which is twice slower than the speed of Vilambit-Laya is called 'Ati-Vilambit-Laya'.

**Anudrut-Laya**-The speed which is twice faster than the speed of Drut-Laya is called 'Anudrut-Laya'.

**Adi-Laya**-Adi-Laya means one and a half (1½) measure of a given Laya. In other words, to play three syllables or boles in two units of time is called 'Adi-Laya'.
For example:
`Dha - Dhin Dha - Dha Dhin - Dha.`
`X`

**Kuadi-Laya** - Kuadi-Laya means one and one - fourth (1¼) measure of a given Laya. In other words, to play five syllables in four units of time is called 'Kuadi-Laya'.
For example:
`Dha - - Dhin Dhin Dha - - - Dhin Dhin Dha - -`
`X 2`

**Biadi-Laya** - Biadi-Laya means one and three-fourth (1¾) measure of a given Laya. In other words, to play seven syllables in four units of time.
For example:
`Dha - Dhin - Dhin Dha - Dhin - Dhin Dha`
`X 2`
