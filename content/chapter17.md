### Detailed Description of Fourteen Ragas

#### (1) RAGA YAMAN
**Ascent.** - `Sa Re Ga, Ma' Pa, Dha, Ni 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni Dha, Pa, Ma' Ga, Re Sa`

Raga Yaman is derived from Kalyan Scale (Thata). It is a septatomic Raga, or a Raga of 'Sampurna' variety, having all the seven notes both in the ascent and descent. It take Ma sharp (Teevra) and the remaining Shuddha notes. In other words, it takes all the sharp (Teevra) notes. Its Vadi note is 'Ga' and the Samvadi note is 'Ni'. It is sung in the first quarter of the night, i.e., from 6 P. M. to 9 P. M. It is a Poorvangavadi-Raga* because its Vadi note 'Ga' is in the first part of the Octave. Its catch-notes or 'Pakad' are: `Ni. Re Ga, Re, Sa, Pa Ma' Ga, Re, Sa`.

---
*\*Those Ragas which have their Vadi note in the first part of the Octave, viz., 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa' are called Poorvangavadi-Ragas.*
---

**NAME OF THE RAGA**
The original name of the Raga is 'Kalyan'. This name is found in the ancient Sanskrit books on music. Nowadays it is popularly known as 'Yaman'. Both the names are correct. Some musicians call it as 'Eman'. 'Eman' is a Persian word. Amir Khusro, the celebrated poet and musician of the court of Allauddin Khilji, who flourished in the 13th century, is said to have introduced this name. He is credited to have given new forms or shapes to certain Ragas. It is said that he introduced flat (Komal) 'Ma' in Raga Kalyan, which takes only sharp (Teevra) Ma', and named it as 'Yaman-Kalyan'. Thus, in Yaman only sharp (Teevra) 'Ma' is used while in Yaman-Kalyan both the Madhyams are used. The flat (Komal) 'Ma' in Yaman-Kalyan is used in a peculiar way. It is used neither as '`Ga Ma Pa`' nor as '`Pa Ma Ga`'. In fact, it comes stealthily with 'Ga' in the descent and that also in between two Gandharas thus: `Ni Re Ga Ma Ga, Pa Ma' Ga Re Ga, Ga Ma Ga, Re Sa, Ga Ma Pa Ma' Ga, Re Ga Ma' Ga, Re Sa.` Hence, it can be conveniently said that when Raga Yaman is sung with the use of sharp (Teevra) 'Ma' alone, it remains Yaman as such and when flat (Komal) 'Ma' is inserted in it, it becomes Yaman-Kalyan.

Some musicians say that Yaman and Yaman-Kalyan are one and the same thing. They hold that flat (Komal) 'Ma' is used in Yaman-Kalyan as a Vivadi note. It is not one of the recognised notes of the Raga. Therefore, there is not much difference between the two. But, generally speaking, the former view is accepted by the majority of the musicians, namely, when sharp (Teevra) 'Ma' alone is used in the Raga, it remains Yaman as such and when flat (Komal) 'Ma' is also used in the Ragas, it becomes Yaman-Kalyan.

**NATURE OF THE RAGA**
This is one of the most common Ragas of Hindustani system of music. Almost every musician knows it and can sing it easily. It has straight 'Ascent' and 'Descent'. It is a sober Raga. It has wide scope and is perfectly suitable for the purpose of Alap singing. Among of all the Ragas that are sung in the first quarter of the night Yaman is the first Raga to begin with. In this Raga in order to show 'Ga' and 'Ni' effectively it is necessary to have stoppage or pause on them. This Raga is developed in all the three Octaves.

**Combination of 'Re' and 'Pa'**
In Raga Yaman the combination or the co-existence of 'Re' and 'Pa' is frequently shown. For example, `Ni Re Ga Ma' Pa, Re, Sa, Ma' Pa Dha, Ma' Ga, Pa Re, Ni Re Sa, Pa Ma' Ga, Pa, Re, Sa, Ga Ma' Pa, Re, Sa.` This sort of combination of 'Pa' and 'Re' looks very beautiful in this Raga.

**Commencement of 'Antara'**
The 'Antara' of this Raga is mostly begun in this way : `Ma' Ga Ma' Dha Sa' or Ma' Ga Pa Dha Pa 'Sa or Ga Ga, Pa Dha Pa, 'Sa, 'Sa.`

**Use of flat (Komal) 'Ma'**
In Raga Yaman sometimes flat (Komal) 'Ma' is used very skillfully as 'Vivadi' note in order to create beauty in the Raga. But, flat (Komal) 'Ma' is very sparingly used and that also with 'Ga' in the 'Descent'. It comes almost stealthily between two Gandharas, i.e., first 'Ga' is pronounced and then Komal 'Ma' and then again 'Ga'. For example, `Ga Ma Ga, Pa Ma Ga Re Sa, Ga Ma' Pa Ma' Ga, Re Ga Ma' Ga, Pa Ni Dha Pa, Ma' Ga, Re Ga, Ma Pa, Ma, Ga Ma Ga Re, Re Sa.`

**Speciality of the Raga**
The speciality of the Raga rests on `Ga Re Sa, Ni. Re Ga, Re Sa`. This is the main combination of the Raga and it occurs in it not infrequently.

**Shape or form of the Raga**

</pre>

#### (2) Raga Bilawal
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, 'Sa.`
**Descent.** - `'Sa, Ni, Dha, Pa, Ma, Ga, Re, Sa.`

Raga Bilawal is derived from Bilawal Scale. It is a septa-tonic Raga or a Raga of Sampurna variety. It takes all the seven notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It has all the Shuddha notes. Its vadi note is 'Dha' and the Samvadi note is 'Ga'. It is sung in the morning after sunrise. It is an Uttranga-vadi-Raga because its vadi note is in the second part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are : `Sa, Ga Ma Ga Re, Ga Pa, Dha Ni, Dha Ni 'Sa`.

Bilawal Raga looks somewhat like 'Kalyan' Raga. It is, therefore, sometimes called as the morning 'Kalyan'. It may be called as the counterpart of 'Kalyan'.

In this Raga 'Ga' and 'Ni' are crooked notes or 'Vakra-Swaras'. 'Ni' is crooked in the Ascent thus : `'Dha Ni Dha 'Sa'` and 'Ga' is crooked in the Descent thus : `Ma Ga Ma Re Sa`. When the Raga is sung showing these two notes as crooked, it looks very beautiful.

**SHAPE OR FORM OF THE RAGA**
<pre>
                                     Dha
Sa, Re Ga,  Ma Ga Re, Ga Pa, Pa, Dha Ga, Ma Re, Ga,
Ma Pa Ma Ga, Ma Re, Sa; Sa, Re Ga, Ma Re, Ga Pa, Pa Dha, Pa,

Dha, Ma Ga, Ma Re, Sa; Pa Pa, Dha Ni, Dha Ni Sa, Sa Re Ga
Sa Re Ga, Ma Ga, Ma Re Sa, Dha Ni Sa Re 'Ga' Re Sa, Dha Pa,
Pa Pa Dha Ni Ga, Dha Pa, Ma Pa, Ma Ga, Dha, Dha Ni Pa,
Dha Ni Sa, Dha Pa Ma Pa, Ma Ga, Ma Re Ga.
</pre>

#### (3) Raga Alahiya - Bilawal
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Re, Ga Re, Ga Pa, Dha, Ni Dha, Ni 'Sa.`
**Descent.** - `'Sa, Ni Dha, Pa, Dha Ni_ Dha Pa, Ma Ga, Ma Re Sa`

Raga Alahiya - Bilawal is derived from Bilawal scale. It is a Raga of 'Shadava - Sampurna' variety. It takes six notes in the Ascent and seven notes in the Descent. Because it drops 'Ma' in the Ascent and takes all the seven notes in the Descent. It has all the Shuddha notes but takes flat (Komal) 'Ni_', along with 'Dha', in the Descent, e.g. `'Dha Ni_ Dha Pa'`. Its vadi note is 'Dha' and the Samvadi note is 'Ga'. It is sung in the morning, i.e., after sunrise. It is an 'Uttrangavadi-Raga' because its vadi note 'Dha' is in the second part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are: `Ga Re, Ga Pa, Dha, Ni Dha Ni 'Sa, or Dha Ni_ Dha Pa, Ma Ga, Ma Re, Sa.`

It is a variety of 'Bilawal Raga'. In this Raga 'Ma' is omitted in the Ascent and flat (Komal) 'Ni_' is used, along with 'Dha', in the Descent. And this is why it is called Alahiya-Bilawal. In other words, when in Raga Bilawal 'Ma' is omitted in the Ascent and flat (Komal) 'Ni_' is taken, along with 'Dha', in the Descent, it becomes Alahiya-Bilawal. The difference between Bilawal and Alahiya-Bilawal is that in Bilawal all the Shuddha notes are used in the Ascent and Descent while in Alahiya - Bilawal 'Ma' is off in the Ascent and flat (Komal) 'Ni_' is used, along with Dha, in the Descent as `'Dha Ni_ Dha Pa'`. It is said to be a mixture of Sampurna and Bilawal Ragas. In this Raga 'Ga' and 'Ni' are crooked notes in the Descent and Ascent respectively. For example, 'Ma Ga Ma Re Sa', here 'Ga' is the crooked note or Vakra-Swara in the Descent. And `'Dha Ni Dha 'Sa'`, here 'Ni' is the crooked note or Vakra-Swara in the Ascent.

#### (4) RAGA KHAMAJ
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Ga, Ma Pa, Dha Ni 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni_ Dha Pa, Ma Ga Re Sa`

Raga Khamaj is derived from Khamaj Scale. It is a Raga of 'Shadava - Sampurna' variety having six notes in the Ascent and seven notes in the Descent. It drops 'Re' in the Ascent and takes all the notes in the Descent. It takes both flat (Komal) and sharp (Teevra) 'Ni' and the remaining Shuddha notes. Its vadi note is 'Ga' and the samvadi note is 'Ni'. It is sung in the second quarter of the night at about 9 p.m. It is a 'Poorvangavadi Raga' because its vadi note is in the first part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are : `Ni_ Dha, Ma Pa Dha, Ma Ga.`

**Nature of the Raga**
The name of the Raga is Khamaj. Some people call it 'Khamach'. But the correct name is 'Khamaj'. It is supposed to be a very old Raga. It is a sweet and popular Raga. It was very popular during the Muslim rule. Even now, it is an accomplished Raga of the Mohammadan singers. And, this is why we find quite a good number of 'Ghazals', 'Thumris' (styles of Singing) and other lively songs composed in this Raga. Khyals and Thumris, are mostly sung in this Raga but very few 'Dhrupads' and 'Dhamars'. In this Raga 'Tanas' sung with fast speed look simply charming. Whenever a singer wants to attract the audience with fast 'Tanas', he mostly takes up this Raga for displaying his skill of fast 'Tanas'.

**Use of 'Pancham'**
In this Raga 'Pa' is usually avoided rather it is very sparingly used in the Ascent. Thus, the Ascent is mostly sung like this : `'Ga Ma Dha Ni 'Sa'`. Even the 'Antara' of this Raga is begun thus: `'Ga Ma Dha Ni 'Sa'` or `'Ga Ma Ni Dha Ni 'Sa'`. The reason is that 'Pa' is such a peculiar note that whenever it is crossed to reach another note, stoppage has got to be made on it and only then it looks, beautiful. But such a stoppage on 'Pa' mars the beauty of Raga Khamaj. Besides, in the Ragas having 'Ga' as their vadi note 'Pa' is usually avoided in the Ascent. Therefore, 'Pa' is generally avoided in the Ascent in this Raga. As a matter of fact, there is no bar as regards the use of 'Pa' in the Ascent. Those who want to take it in the Ascent may do so, just avoiding 'Dha', in this manner : `Ga Ma Pa Ni 'Sa`. Because 'Pa' and 'Dha', when taken one after the other in the Ascent, do not look beautiful in this Raga. The use of 'Pa' and 'Dha' one after the other is not banned in any way, but it is usually avoided because it does not look beautiful.

**Speciality of the Raga**
The chief notes of this Raga are 'Ga', 'Ma', 'Pa' and 'Ni_'. The beauty of this Raga hinges on these four notes and most Tanas conclude on these notes. The flat (komal) 'Ni_' is one of the beautiful notes of this Raga and is like the flat (Komal) 'Ni_' of Raga 'Sorath'.

**Shape or form of the Raga**
`Sa, Ga, Ma Pa, Ga Ma, Ni Dha, Ma Pa Dha, Ma Ga, Pa, Ma Ga Re Sa; Ni_ Sa Ga, Ma Ga, Ma Pa Dha, Ma Ga, Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni_ Dha, Ma Ga, Ga Ma Pa Dha Pa Sa, Ni_ Dha, Ma Pa Dha, Ma Ga, Pa, Ma Ga Re Sa; Sa, Ga Ma Ni Dha, Ni Sa, Ni_ 'Sa, Ni_ Ni_, Sa Re, Sa, Ni Dha, Ma Dha Ni Sa, Ni Dha, Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa Ni Dha, Ma Pa Ni Dha, Ma Ga, Pa Ma, Ga Ma Ga Re Sa.`

#### (5) RAGA BHAIRAVA
**Ascent.** - `Sa Re_ Ga Ma, Pa Dha_, Ni 'Sa,`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni_ Dha_ Pa Ma Ga, Re_, Sa.`

Raga Bhairava is derived from Bhairava Scale. It is a Septatonic Raga or a Raga of 'Sampurna' variety having all the seven notes, both in the ascent and descent. It takes 'Re_' and 'Dha_' flat (Komal) and the remaining Shuddha notes. Its 'Vadi' note is Dha and the 'Samvadi' note is 'Re_'. It is sung in the morning, rather in the early hours of the morning. It is an 'Uttrangavadi-Raga'* because its 'Vadi' note 'Dha_' is in the second part of the Octave. The catch-notes (Pakad) of the Raga are, `Sa, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha_, Pa.`

---
*\*The Ragas which have their 'Vadi' note in the second part of the Octave i.e., 'Ma Pa Dha Ni 'Sa', are called 'Uttrangavadi-Ragas'.*
---

**Nature of the Raga**
Bhairava is an old and sober Raga. It looks particularly charming when sung in slow speed. But when it is sung in fast speed, it loses its charm and at the same time the tinge of its allied Ragas, such as Ramkali and Kalingda, is likely to come in. It is known as the morning 'Sandhi-Prakash-Raga'** because it is sung between 4 to 7 in the morning. The development of this Raga takes place mostly in the lower Octave or 'Mandra-Saptak'. And musicians generally do not descend below 'Ma' in the lower Octave, e.g., `Sa. Dha. Pa, Ma, Pa, Dha. Sa, Re_ Re_ Sa.` It is a sober raga and fast Tanas are usually not sung in it. Expert musicians even do not sing the amorous and romantic songs like 'Thumri' in this Raga. And, in fact, 'Thumri' style of singing does not fit in, in this Raga.

---
*\*\*Sandhi-Prakash-Raga - 'Sandhi' means junction and 'Prakash' means light. 'Sandhi-Prakash' means junction between day and night or the junction of day and night, i.e., the time when day and night meet. This time comes twice in twenty four hours, at sunrise and at sunset. According to the time-theory of Ragas the 'Sandhi-Prakash' period is commonly reckoned from 4 to 7 in the morning and 4 to 7 in the evening. The Ragas which have 'Re' and 'Dha' flat (Komal) and which are sung between 4 A.M. to 7 A.M. and 4 P.M. to 7 P.M. are called Sandhi-Prakash-Ragas.*
---

**Use of Flat (Komal) 'RE' and 'DHA'**
The notes 'Re_' and 'Dha_' of this Raga are more flat (Komal) than the 'Re_' and 'Dha_' of 'Kalingda' and 'Bhairavi'. These two notes oscillate between their true pitches and their preceding Shrutis. In other words, these two notes, so to say, play hide and seek round their fixed frequencies. They remain oscillated or 'Andolit', e.g.,
<pre>
        Sa                Dha_
----Ga-----------------Pa, Ma, Pa, Ma Ga Ma
(Ma), Re_-----Sa, or Sa, Re_-----Sa, Ni. Sa, Re_-----Sa,
        Ni                Ga
----Dha_------------Ni Sa, Re_----, Ga Ma, Re_----Sa
</pre>
(`_` This is the sign of vibration or oscillation). And this sort of use of flat (Komal) 'Re_' and 'Dha_' in this Raga looks exceedingly beautiful, nay, it is the speciality of the Raga. Besides, these two notes occur frequently in this Raga.

**Speciality of the Raga**
The beauty of Raga Bhairava hinges on flat (Komal) 'Re_' and 'Dha_'. These two notes remain oscillating all the time in the Raga. In fact, Raga Bhairava must have oscillating 'Re_' and 'Dha_'. If the note combination '`Dha_, Pa, Ma Ga Re_`' is sung slowly and soberly, it atonce indicates the Raga. And immediately after this if the notes `Sa Dha_, Sa Re_ Re_, Sa, Ma Ga Re_, Sa`, are sung the picture of the Raga becomes manifest. Not only this, if '`Ma Ga Re_ Sa`' these four notes alone are sung with 'Meend', they atonce indicate the Raga. Bhairava is an Uttrangavadi-Raga.*** Its beauty is more discernable in the descent. Thus, when the note-combination `Re_ Re_ Sa, Dha_ Ni Sa, Re_ Re_, Sa, Ma Ga Re_ Sa, Pa Ma Ga Re_, Sa, Dha_ Pa, Ma Ga Re_ Ga Pa Ma Ga Re_, Sa` is sung in a powerful tone, it creates a great effect on the mind of the listeners. Not only this, but when 'Ma' is pronounced strongly and a descent is made with 'Meend' up to 'Re_', sounding the intermediary note 'Ga' that also creates very good effect on the mind, e.g. `Ma Ga, Ma, <sup>Ga</sup>Re_---Sa`.

---
*\*\*\*Those Ragas which have their 'Vadi' note in the second part of the Octave, viz., 'Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa' are called 'Uttrangavadi' Ragas.*
---

**Use of flat (Komal) 'Re' in the Ascent**
In Raga Bhairava flat (Komal) 'Re_' is sparingly used in the ascent and is often dropped. This is done so because of the facility in pronouncing the notes. Besides, it creates beauty in the Raga. Thus, in the ascent the Raga runs in this manner : `Ni. Sa Ga Ma Pa Dha_, Pa Ma Ga Re_ Sa.`

**Commencement of the Raga**
The singing of Raga Bhairava usually begins, like this: `'Sa, Ma Ga, Ma Pa, Dha_ Dha_, Pa, Ma Ga Re_, Ga Ma Pa Ma Ga Re_, Re_, Sa'` or `'Sa Dha_ Dha_, Pa, Ma Pa, Ma Ga, Ma Ga Re_, Ga Ma Ga Re_, Sa,'` or `'Dha_ Sa, Re_ Re_, Sa, Ma Ga Re_, Sa'` etc.

**Commencement of Antara**
The Antara of this Raga mostly starts like this: `'Pa Dha_ Ni Sa, or Ma Pa Pa Dha_, Ni Sa, Dha_, Ni 'Sa Ni 'Sa Dha_, Pa'`.

**Shape or Form of the Raga**

</pre>

#### (6) RAGA POORVI
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Re_, Ga, Ma', Pa Dha_, Ni, 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni, Dha_ Pa, Ma', Ga, Re_ Sa`

Raga Poorvi is derived from 'Poorvi' Scale. It is a septatonic Raga or a Raga of 'Sampurna' variety. It takes all the notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It has 'Re_' and 'Dha_' flat (Komal), 'Ma'' Sharp (Teevra) and the remaining 'Shuddha' notes. Its vadi note is 'Ga' and the 'Samvadi' note is 'Ni'. It is sung in the last quarter of the day, i.e., between 4 to 6 P.M. It is a Poorvangavadi-Raga because its vadi note is in the first part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are : `Ni., Sa Re_ Ga, Ma' Ga, Ma', Ga, Re_ Ga Re_ Sa.`

**Nature of the Raga**
It is a common evening Raga. It is also a sober Raga. Whenever a musician begins to sing in the evening, he usually begins with this Raga. It can be easily identified and easily learnt. After having sung the Ragas which take flat (Komal) 'Ga_', such as Bhimpalasi, Dhanashri, Multani etc., Poorvi with sharp (Teevra) 'Ga' has a charm peculiarly its own. Sometimes when Ragas like Shri, Gouri, Triveni, etc. are sung by inexperienced singers without strictly observing their independent rules, they often merge them with Poorvi. It is an evening 'Sandhi-Prakash-Raga'.

**Use of both the 'Madhyamas'**
In this Raga both flat (Komal) and sharp (Teevra) Madhyamas are used. Some Dhrupad singers use only flat (Komal) 'Ma' in this Raga. But all Khyal singers use both flat and sharp Madhyamas in this Raga. They argue that if only sharp (Teevra) 'Ma'' is used in this Raga and flat (Komal) Ma is set aside, it is likely to become Poorya-Dhanashri Raga. Therefore, both the Madhyamas must be used in this Raga. But flat (Komal) 'Ma' should be pronounced softly and that also in between two 'Gandharas' thus `Ma' Ga Ma Ga`. In fact, this use of flat (Komal) 'Ma' in the Descent along with two 'Gandharas' produces a special charm in the Raga.

**Use of 'Dha' in the Raga**
The flat (Komal) 'Dha_' of Poorvi is one 'Shruti' higher than the flat (Komal) 'Dha_' of 'Shri' Raga. Some musicians use sharp (Teevra) 'Dha' also in this Raga. Others use both the flat (Komal) and sharp (Teevra) 'Dha'. Those who use both the 'Dhaivatas' in this Raga they take sharp (Teevra) 'Dha' in the Ascent and flat (Komal) 'Dha_' in the Descent. But flat (Komal) 'Dha_' is commonly used by majority of the musicians, and that is the current practice.

**Shape or Form of the Raga**
`Ga Re_ Sa, Ni., Re_, Sa; Ni_ Sa Re_ Ga, Re_ Ga, Ma' Ga, Pa Ma', Ga, Re_ Ga, Ma' Ga, Ga, Re, Sa; Ni, Sa Re_ Ga Be Ga Ma' Ga, Pa Ma' Ga, Dha_ Pa Ma' Ga, Ma' Ga Re_ Ga, Ma' Dha Ma' Ga, Re_, Sa, Ni Re_ Sa; Ma' Ga, Ma' Dha_ Ma', Sa, Sa, Ni Re_, Sa, Ni Re_, Ga Re_, Sa, Re Sa, Ni, Dha_, Re_, Ni, Dha_, Pa, Ma' Dha_ Ni Re_ Ni Dha_ Pa, Pa Dha_ Ma' Pa; Ma' Ga, Ma' Ga, Ni Re_ Ga, Ma' Dha_ Ma' Ga, Re_ Ga, Ga, Re, Ni Re_ Sa.`

#### (7) RAGA MARWA
**Ascent.** - `Sa Re_, Ga, Ma', Dha, Ni Dha, 'Sa.`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni Dha, Ma' Ga Re_, Sa.`

Raga Marwa is derived from Marwa Scale. It is a hexatonic Raga or a Raga of 'Shadava' variety. It takes six notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It drops 'Pa' both in the Ascent and Descent. It has 'Re_' flat (Komal), 'Ma'' sharp (Teevra) and the remaining shuddha notes. It has 'Re_' Vadi and 'Dha' Samvadi. It is sung in the last quarter of the day. It is a Poorvangavadi-Raga because its Vadi note is in the first part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are: `Dha Ma' Ga Re_, Ga Ma' Ga, Re_ Sa.`

**'Re' and 'Ni' Crooked notes**
In this Raga 'Ni' and 'Re_' are crooked notes or 'Vakra-Swara' in the Ascent and Descent respectively. 'Ni' is crooked in the Ascent thus : `Ga Ma' Dha Ni Dha 'Sa`, and 'Re_' is crooked in the Descent thus : `Ga Re_ Ga Ma' Re_ Sa`. This Raga becomes manifest when 'Re_' is used as a crooked note in the Descent.

**Commencement of the Raga**
Some musicians begin this Raga thus : `'Sa Re_ Sa, Ma' Ga, Re_ Ga, Ma' Dha Ma' Ga Re_, Ma' Ga Re_, Sa`. Others begin this Raga thus `Dha Ma' Ga Re_, Ga Ma' Ga Re_, Sa, Re_ Ni. Dha., Ma' Dha 'Sa, Sa, Re_ Ga, Ma' Dha` or `Ga Dha Ma Ga, Ma' Ga Re_, Re_ Ma' Ga`.

**Commencement of 'Antara'**
The 'Antara' of this Raga is begun in this manner : `'Ga, Ma' Dha, 'Sa'` and some begin like this: `'Ga, Ma' Dha Ma' 'Sa, 'Sa, Ni Re_ 'Sa, 'Sa'`.

**Speciality of the Raga**
The speciality of this Raga rests on the three notes, viz., 'Re_', 'Ga' and 'Dha'. It is also known as the evening Sandhi-Prakash Raga. This Raga is also called a 'Para-Mela-Praveshak' Raga, i. e., a Raga which acts as a harbinger to the Ragas of another scale (Thata) to be sung immediately after this Raga. In other words, this Raga indicates the period of transition from one scale (Thata) to another scale (Thata), i. e., it takes the singer from the Ragas of Marwa scale to the Ragas belonging to Kalyan scale, viz., from the flat (Komal) 'Re_' and 'Dha' group of Ragas to the sharp (Teevra) 'Re' and 'Dha' group of Ragas. Hence, it is called a Para-Mela-Praveshak Raga.

**Shape or Form of the Raga**
`Ga, Re_, Sa, Ni. Re_, Sa, Ni. Re_ Ga Re_ Ga, Ma' Ga, Re_ Sa; Ni. Re_ Ga, Ma' Ga, Dha Ma_ Ga, Re_ Ga Ma' Dha, Ni Dha, Ma' Ga, Re_, Dha, Ma' Ga, Re_, Ga, Re_ Sa, Ni Re_, Sa; Ni.

(Continuation of Chapter XVII)

#### (8) RAGA KAPHI
**Ascent.** - `Sa Re Ga_, Ma Pa, Dha Ni_ 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni_ Dha, Pa, Ma Ga_, Re Sa`

Raga Kaphi is derived from Kaphi scale. It is a septatonic Raga or a Raga of 'Sampurna' variety having all the seven notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It takes 'Ga_' and 'Ni_' flat (Komal) and the remaining Shuddha notes. Its 'Vadi' note is 'Pa' and the 'Samvadi' note is 'Sa'. Some people take 'Ga_' Vadi and 'Ni_' Samvadi. But according to the present writer it is more correct to have 'Pa' Vadi and 'Sa' Samvadi. Its time for singing is midnight. According to some musicians it can be sung at any time of the day and night. But still it should not be sung at the 'Sandhi-Prakash' time, i.e., between 4 to 7 both in the morning and evening. The catch-notes of the Raga are : `<sup>Ma</sup>Sa, Re Re, Ga_ Ga_, Ma Ma Pa,` or `Sa Re Re_ Ga_, <sup>Ma</sup>Sa, Re Pa` or `Sa Re Ga_ Re Ga_ Ma Pa Ma Pa`.

**Nature of the Raga**
It is a simple Raga. It is also a sweet and popular Raga. Every musician can sing it easily. It can also be easily understood by all. This Raga is not suitable for 'Vilambit' (slow) Alap work. Even 'Meend' and 'Gamak' work does not look beautiful in this Raga. It is very popular ever since the Mohammadan period. In this Raga Tappa, Thumri, 'Ghazal' and other light variety of songs are mostly sung. It is very frequently sung during the 'Holi' Festival (colour throwing festival). Its speciality lies on 'Sa, Ga_,' 'Pa' and 'Ni_' these four notes. The beauty of the Raga hinges on these four notes.

**Use of Sharp (Teevra) 'Ga' and 'Ni'**
In this Raga sometimes sharp 'Ga' and 'Ni' are used as 'Vivadi' notes for creating beauty in the Raga. For example, sharp 'Ga' is used in the Ascent thus : `Ni Dha Pa, Ni Dha Pa, Ni_ Dha Pa Ma Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni 'Sa, Pa Ni_ Dha Pa Ma Ga_ Ma Pa, Ga Ma Pa Ma Ga Re Sa Re Pa.` And Sharp 'Ni' is used in the Ascent thus : `Ma Ma Pa, Dha, Ni, 'Sa, Ni, 'Sa Re 'Sa Ni_ Dha Pa` or `Ma Ma Pa Dha Ni, 'Sa, Ni, 'Sa, 'Re, 'Sa, Ga_ Re Sa`. Thus, both sharp (Teevra) 'Ga' and sharp (Teevra) 'Ni' are used only in the Ascent and not in the Descent.

**Commencement of the 'Antara'**
The 'Antara' of this Raga commences thus : `Ma Ma Pa Dha Ni, 'Sa, Dha Ni 'Sa, Ga_ Re Sa, <sup>Ma</sup>Ga_ Re Sa, Ni_ Dha Ni_ Pa Dha Ma Pa, 'Sa, Ni Dha, Ma Pa Dha Pa, Ma Pa, Ga_ Re, Ma Ga_ Re Sa, Sa, Re Re Ga_, Sa, Re Pa.`

#### (9) RAGA ASAWARI
**Ascent.** - `'Sa, Re Ma Pa, Dha_, 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Ma Ga_, Re Sa`

Raga Asawari is derived from Asawari Scale. It is a Raga of 'Odava-Sampurna' variety having five notes in the Ascent and seven notes in the Descent. It takes 'Ga_', 'Dha_' and 'Ni_' flat (Komal) and the remaining Shuddha notes. Its Vadi note is 'Dha_' and the Samvadi note is 'Ga_'. It is sung in the second quarter of the day, i.e., after singing Raga Todi and between 9 to 11 O'clock in the morning. It is an 'Uttaranga-vadi' Raga because its Vadi note 'Dha_' is in the second part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are : `Re Ma Pa, Ni_ Dha_, Pa`, or `Dha_, Ma, Pa <sup>Pa</sup> Dha_`, `<sup>Ma</sup>Ga_ Re Sa`, `Re Ma Pa, Sa., Dha_, Pa.`

**Nature of the Raga**
It is a sweet and popular Raga. It takes all the flat (Komal) notes except 'Re' which is sharp (Teevra). All its flat (Komal) notes are similar to those of the flat (Komal) notes of Raga Bhairavi. Its allied Ragas are Jaunpuri and Gandhari.

**Use of 'Rishabh'**
This Raga always takes sharp (Teevra) 'Re'. Some musicians take flat (Komal) 'Re_' in this Raga. All the Khyal singers of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh use sharp 'Re' in this Raga. It is said that Ustad Wazir Khan Saheb of Rampur, the famous court musician, used both the Rishabhas (Komal and Teevra 'Re') in this Raga. Both the varieties of Asawari, viz., the one having sharp 'Rishabha' and the other having both the 'Rishabhas' are quite sweet to hear. But, it becomes difficult to take flat (Komal) 'Re_' in swift 'Tanas'. Those who take flat 'Re_' in this Raga, they sing it thus:
<pre>
               Ni_
Ma Pa, Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Dha_, Pa, Ma Pa
Ma      Sa
Dha_    Ga_, Re_, Sa, Re_ Dha_, 'Sa, Ga_, Re_, Sa,
Pa, Ni_ Dha_ Pa, Ma       Pa Ni_ Dha_ Dha_, Pa,
Pa Dha_ Ga_ Re_ Re_, Sa
</pre>

**Commencement of the Raga**
Some musicians begin this Raga in this manner : `Ma Pa Ni_ Dha_, Pa.` Others begin in this way `<sup>Ni</sup> Dha_ Ni_ Ma_ Dha_-Dha_. Pa, Ma Pa, Ga_, Re Sa.` Still others begin thus : `Ma Pa, Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Dha_ Ga_, Re Sa.` All these methods of commencing the Raga are quite correct. But it must be kept in mind that in the upper half of the Octave `Ni Dha, Pa` this combination of notes must come and in the lower half of the Octave `Dha Ma Pa Ga_` these notes must come in. Because, `Ni_ Dha_, Pa` or `Ma Pa Ga_` or `Dha_ Ma Pa Ga_ Re, Sa` these three sets of notes are very important in Asawari.

**Speciality of the Raga**
The Speciality of the Raga lies on 'Ga_', 'Pa' and 'Dha_'. These three notes and Komal 'Ni_' in the Descent look very beautiful in the Raga. The entire beauty and utility of the Descent of this Raga rests on Komal 'Ni_'. In the descent after pronouncing `'Ni_ Dha_'` there must be some pause over 'Dha_' and then 'Pa' should be pronounced, e.g., `'Sa 'Ni Dha_, Pa`. These three notes are very important in the Raga and they clearly indicate the Raga.

**Shape or Form of the Raga**
`Sa, Re Ma, Pa, Pa, Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Dha_ Ma, Pa Dha_ Ma Pa, Ga_, Re Sa, Re Ma, Pa, Sa, Dha_ Pa; Sa, Re Sa, Ni_ Dha_, Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Ma Pa Dha_, Sa, Re Ma Pa Dha Ma Pa Ga_, Re, Sa, Re Ma, Pa, Sa, Dha_, Pa; Sa, Re Ma Pa, Pa Dha_, Pa, Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Sa, Ni Dha_, Pa, Re Sa, Ni Dha_, Pa, Ga Ga_ Re Re Sa, Re Sa, Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Ma Pa Ni_ Dha_, Pa, Dha_ Ma Pa Ga_, Re_ Sa, Re Ma, Pa, Sa, Dha_, Pa`

#### (10) RAGA BHAIRAVI
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Re_ Ga_ Ma, Pa Dha_, Ni_ 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa, Ni_ Dha_ Pa, Ma Ga_, Re_ Sa`

Raga Bhairavi is derived from Bhairavi Scale. It is a septatonic Raga or a Raga of Sampurna variety having all the seven notes, both in the Ascent and Descent. It takes all the flat (Komal) notes. Its Vadi note is 'Ma' and the Samvadi note is 'Sa'. But, some musicians accept 'Dha_' Vadi and 'Ga_' Samvadi. It is sung in the morning. According to some musicians it can be sung at any time in the day or night. But it looks more beautiful and charming when sung in the morning. In practice, it is sung from morning till 12-noon. It is an Uttarangavadi Raga because its Vadi note is in the second part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are `Ma_ Ga_, Sa Re_ Sa, Dha_ Ni_ Sa` or `Ga_, Sa Re_ Sa.`

**Nature of the Raga**
It is a sweet and popular Raga. It is also a simple and commonly loved Raga and almost all the musicians can sing it easily. In this Raga Ghazals, Tappa, Thumri, Dadra etc. are commonly sung and these styles of songs are very sweet to hear. In this Raga pure classical and classico-romantic songs like Dhrupad, Dhamar and Khyal are less sung instead purely romantic and amorous songs like Thumri, Tappa, Ghazal etc. are not infrequently sung. In fact, Bhairavi is such a sweet Raga that it hardly fails to convey its effect upon the listeners.

**Difference of Opinion about Vadi Note**
In this Raga some musicians take 'Ma' as Vadi note while others accept 'Dha_' as Vadi note. According to the present writer it is more correct to have 'Ma' as Vadi note in this Raga. Because 'Ma' is one of the important notes of the Raga. Secondly, 'Ma' is most frequently used in this Raga. Thirdly, our writers on music have unanimously accepted 'Ma' as the Graha\* Nyas\* and Ansha\* Swara of this Raga. Therefore, it is all the more correct to take 'Ma' as the Vadi note in this Raga.

---
*\* **'Graha-Swara'** is the starting note of a Raga or the note with which the singing of a Raga commences. **'Nyas-Swara'** is the concluding note of a Raga or the note on which stoppage is made. **'Ansha-Swara'** is the prominent note or the vadi note of a Raga.*
---

As a matter of fact, it is not incorrect to take 'Dha_' as the Vadi note in this Raga, but, in practice, most of the musicians accept 'Ma' as the Vadi note and also it is very much current. Those who take 'Ma' as Vadi note they frequently use it in this manner : `Sa Re_ Ma, Pa Ga_ Re Sa, Dha_ Ni_ Sa, Re_ Sa, Re_ Sa, Ma, Re_ Sa, Ma Pa Ma, Dha_ Pa Ma, Pa Ma Ga_, Re_ Sa. Dha_ Pa Dha_ Ma, Ma Ma, Sa Re_ Ma, Pa, Dha_ Pa Ma, Sa Ni_ Dha_ Pa, Dha_ Ma, Sa Re_ Ga_, Ma, Ga_ Re Sa`. And those who accept 'Dha_' as Vadi note they use it thus : `Sa Dha_, Pa Dha_, Ma Pa, Ga_ Ma Pa, Dha_ Pa Ma Ga_, Re Sa; Sa, Pa, Pa, Dha_ Pa, Ga_ Pa, Pa Dha_, Pa, Sa Ga_ Ma Dha_, Pa Ma Ga_, Re_ Sa.`

It is true that when this Raga is sung taking the said two different Vadi notes separately, there does occur some difference in the development as well as in the effect of the two varieties. All the same when this Raga is sung with 'Ma' as Vadi note, it sounds particularly sweet and beautiful.

**Use of flat (Komal) 'Re'**
The Komal 'Re_' of this Raga is slightly higher or one 'Shruti' higher than the Komal 'Re_' of Bhairava. In the Ascent 'Re_' is weak in this Raga and when fast 'Tanas' are sung, it is often dropped in the Ascent. But when 'Re_' is used in the Ascent, slight stoppage is usually made on it.

**Use of 'Vivadi' Note**
In this Raga sometimes 'Re', 'Ma' and 'Ni' these three Teevra Swaras or sharp notes are also used as VIVADI notes for creating beauty in the Raga. Some musicians use all the Shuddha and Vikrit Swaras in this Raga for making it more sweet and beautiful. The use of all the Shuddha and Vikrit Swaras, no doubt, create additional beauty in this Raga. And such a variety of Bhairavi is very much current these days and also sweet to hear. In fact, the real Bhairavi having all the Komal Swaras is gradually losing its importance and the current Bhairavi having all the Shuddha and Vikrit Swaras is gaining currency. But inspite of all this, the real Bhairavi having only the Komal Swaras has its own peculiar charm.

**Commencement of the Raga**
The singing of this Raga is begun in different ways. Some musicians begin this Raga like this : `Sa., Sa Re_ Ma, Ma Pa, Ga_, Sa Re_ Ni_ Sa.` Others begin it in this way : `Sa Re_ Ma, Ga_, Re_ Sa, Ma Ga_ Re_ Sa.` Still others begin it thus `Ni_ Sa Ga_ Ma Dha_, Pa` and again still others begin it thus : `Dha_ Pa Dha_ Ma Pa Ga_, Re Sa, Sa - Ga, Ma Ga_, Re Sa.` Some musicians begin the 'Antara' of this Raga thus `Ma, Dha_ Ni_ 'Sa.` Others begin the Antara thus : `Dha_- Ma Dha_-Ni_ 'Sa.` Still others begin it this way : `Ga_ Ma Dha_ Ni_ 'Sa`.

The beauty of this Raga lies on Sa, Ga_, Ma, Pa and Dha_ these five notes.

#### (11) RAGA TODI
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Re_ Ga_, Ma' Pa, Dha_, Ni 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni Dha_, Pa, Ma' Ga_, Re_, Sa`

Raga Todi is derived from Todi Scale. It is a septatonic Raga or a Raga of Sampurna variety having all the seven notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It takes 'Re_', 'Ga_' and 'Dha_' flat (Komal) notes and 'Ma'' and 'Ni' sharp (Teevra) notes. Its Vadi note is 'Dha_' and the Samvadi note is 'Ga_'. Some musicians take 'Re_' as the Samvadi note. But most of the musicians accept 'Ga_' as the Samvadi note. The latter view is more correct. Again, some musicians take 'Ga_' as the vadi note. But this view seems to be incorrect. Because, Todi is an 'Uttaranga-Pradhan' Raga or the Raga which predominates and flourishes in the higher half of the Octave. Therefore, it is more correct to accept 'Dha_' as the Vadi note in this Raga. It is sung in the second quarter of the day. The catch-notes of this Raga are : `Dha_. Ni. Sa, Re_, Ga_, Re_, Sa, Ma', Ga_, Re_ Ga_, Re_, Sa.`

**Varieties of Todi**
There are different varieties of Todi. Some musician accept 12 varieties of Todi while others accept 14 varieties, e.g., Shuddha-Todi or Darbari-Todi, Asawari-Todi, Jaunpuri-Todi, Bilaskhani-Todi, Gandhari-Todi, Bahaduri-Todi, Lachari-Todi, etc. The Raga which is called Todi is also known as Shuddha-Todi or Darbari-Todi or Miyan-ki-Todi. These three names represent one and the same Raga popularly known as Todi. In other words, Raga Todi is recognised by the said three names. The other names of Todi are the different varieties of Todi.

**History of the Raga**
The name Todi is found in the famous treatise entitled 'Sangeet Ratnakar' written by Pandit Sharanga Deva. In this book Todi is said to have been derived from 'Gram-Raga'. But it is difficult to tell as to what kind of Todi it was. In fact, it is not possible to give the precise idea of any of the Ragas mentioned in 'Sangeet Ratnakar' unless and until the notes of the 'Shadja-Grama or Madhyama-Grama' given in the book are properly deciphered. But since the notes of the said two Gramas have not been ascertained up to this day, therefore the correct idea of Todi and for the matter of that even that of other Ragas cannot be had.

The medieval writers like Lochan, Ahobal and others have described the Scale of Todi as that which corresponds with our modern Bhairavi Scale. The old Todi Scale was like this : `Sa Re_ Ga_ Ma Pa Dha_ Ni_ Sa` which is the same as our Bhairavi Scale. And the modern Todi is like this : `Sa Re_ Ga_ Ma' Pa Dha_ Ni 'Sa.`

It has been stated before that Shuddha-Todi, Darbari-Todi and Miyan-ki-Todi are one and the same Raga and these names represent the same Raga popularly known as Todi. It is said that Miyan Tansen inserted Teevra 'Ma'' and Teevra 'Ni' in place of Komal 'Ma' and Komal 'Ni_' in the notes of the ancient Todi and sang it before the Emperor Akbar giving a new shape to it. Since then the modern Todi came into being and that is why it is designated as Darbari-Todi or Miyan-ki-Todi.

**Nature of the Raga**
Todi is a sober Raga. The Komal 'Ga_' of Todi is like the flat (Komal) 'Ga_' of Raga 'Multani'. The speciality of this Raga lies on 'Re_', 'Ga_' and 'Dha_' these notes. In this Raga 'Sapaat-Tanas' are frequently used. Among of all the Ragas that are sung in the morning this Raga is very sober and yet sweet.

**Use of 'Pancham'**
In this Raga 'Pa' is a weak note in the Ascent. Since Sapaat-Tanas are very much used in this Raga, therefore while taking swift Tanas in the Ascent 'Pa' automatically becomes weak because of having the facility in pronouncing the notes. Besides, since the interval of sound between Komal 'Ga_' and Teevra 'Ma'' is pretty long, and after that the interval of sound between Teevra 'Ma'' and 'Pa' and 'Pa' and Komal 'Dha_' are short and then immediately after that the interval of sound between Komal 'Dha_' and Teevra 'Ni' is again very long, therefore while taking fast 'Tanas' it becomes rather difficult to sing these four different intervals of sound, one after the other, with ease and grace. Hence having regard to the facility of pronunciation or utterance of the said three notes 'Pa' is not infrequently left out in the Ascent and the 'Tanas' proceed thus : `Sa Re_ Ga_ Ma' Dha_ Ni 'Sa.`

#### (12) RAGA BHOOPALI
**Ascent.** - `Sa Re Ga Pa, Dha, 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa, Dha Pa, Ga, Re, Sa`

Raga Bhoopali is derived from Kalyan Scale. It is a pentatonic Raga or a Raga of Odava variety having five notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It drops the notes 'Ma' and 'Ni' both in the Ascent and Descent. It has all the Shuddha notes. Its Vadi note is 'Ga' and the Samvadi note is 'Dha'. It is sung in the first quarter of the night. It is a Poorvangavadi Raga because its Vadi note is in the first part of the tetrachord or the first part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are : '`Ga, Re Sa, Sa. Dha. Sa Re Ga, Pa Ga, Dha Pa Ga, Re Sa.`'

**Use of 'Re' and 'Dha'**
The 'Re' and 'Dha' of Bhoopali are sung with a slight touch of their higher neighbours, viz., 'Ga' and 'Sa'. For example, `<sup>Ga</sup>Sa Re, Pa Ga, <sup>Ga</sup>Ga Re, Ga Pa Dha, <sup>Sa</sup>Sa, Dha Pa Ga, <sup>Ga</sup>Ga Re, Pa Ga, Ga Re Sa.`

#### (13) RAGA DES
**Ascent.** - `Sa, Re, Ma Pa, Ni 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa Ni_ Dha Pa, Ma Ga, Re Ga Sa`

Raga Des is derived from Khamaj Scale. It is a Raga of 'Sampurna' variety. It takes all the seven notes both in the Ascent and Descent. It takes both the Nishadas, i.e., Teevra 'Ni' in the Ascent and Komal 'Ni_' in the Descent and the remaining notes are all Shuddha. Its Vadi note is 'Re' and the Samvadi note is 'Pa'. Its catch-notes are : `Re, Ma Pa, Ni Dha Pa, Pa Dha Pa Ma, Ga Re Ga Sa.`

**'Ga' and 'Dha' Weak in the Ascent**
In this Raga 'Ga' and 'Dha' are weak in the Ascent, e.g., `Sa, Re Re, Ma Pa, Ni Dha Pa, Ni, 'Sa.` In fact, 'Ga' and 'Dha' are not omitted in the Ascent but they are very little used in the Ascent. That is why it is called a Raga of 'Sampurna' variety.

**Use of 'Ga' in the Descent**
In this Raga 'Ga' is clearly used in the Descent, e.g., `Re, Ma Pa, Ni_ Dha Pa, Ma Pa Dha Ma Ga Re, Pa Ma Ga Re, Ma Ga Re, Ga Sa, Re Re Ma Pa Dha Ma Ga Re, Pa Ma Ga Re, Ga Sa.`

**Difference of Opinion about the Vadi Note**
In this Raga most of the musicians accept 'Re' as Vadi note but some of them take 'Pa' as Vadi note. In fact, it is more correct to have 'Re' as Vadi note. Because, those Ragas that are derived from Khamaj scale have their Vadi note either 'Re' or 'Ga' but not 'Pa'. Not only this, but, as a rule, those Ragas of the Khamaj scale which mostly resemble Khamaj Raga have 'Ga' as their Vadi note, while those Ragas of the Khamaj scale which resemble 'Sorath' Raga have 'Re' as their Vadi note. But, since Raga 'Des' belongs to Khamaj Scale and also resembles Raga Sorath, therefore it is more correct to have 'Re' as its 'Vadi' note.

**Shape or Form of the Raga**
`Sa, Re Re, Ma Pa, Ni_ Dha Pa, Pa Dha Pa Ma, Ga Re Ga Sa, Re Re Ma Pa, Ni Dha Pa, Ni 'Sa, 'Sa Ni_ Dha Pa, Ma Ga Re, Ga Sa; Ma, Ma Pa, Ni, Ni 'Sa, Pa Ni 'Sa, 'Re, 'Ga Re, Ma Ga Re, Pa Ma Ga Re, Re, Ni_ Sa, Sa, Ni Sa, Re Sa, Ni_ Dha Pa, Re Re Ma Pa, 'Sa, Ni_ Dha Pa, Dha Ma Ga Re, Pa, Ma Ga Re, Ma Ga Re, Ga Sa, Re, Ma Pa, Ni Dha Pa.`

#### (14) RAGA BEHAG
**Ascent.** - `Sa Ga, Ma Pa, Ni 'Sa`
**Descent.** - `'Sa, Ni Dha Pa, Ma Ga Re Sa`

Raga Behag is derived from Bilawal Scale. It is a Raga of 'Odava-Sampurna' variety. It drops 'Re' and 'Dha' in the Ascent and takes all the seven notes in the Descent. It has all the Shuddha notes. Teevra 'Ma'' is used as a Vivadi note for the sake of creating beauty in the Raga. Its Vadi note is 'Ga' and the 'Samvadi' note is 'Ni'. It is sung in the second quarter of the night, from 9 P. M. to 12 mid-night. It is a Poorvangavadi Raga because its Vadi note is in the first part of the Octave. Its catch-notes are : `Ni. Sa, Ga Ma Pa, Ga, Ma Ga, Re Sa.`

**Use of Teevra 'Ma'**
In this Raga sometimes Teevra 'Ma'' is used as a Vivadi note to create beauty in the Raga. In fact, Teevra 'Ma'' is the Vivadi note of this Raga. If it is not used, it will not do any harm to the Raga. The Raga can be fully depicted without the use of Teevra 'Ma''. It is used just to create beauty in the Raga.
